Contingencies (In thousands) : The Company remains a defendant in actions filed in various federal district courts alleging certain violations of the federal anti-trust laws in the marketing of pharmaceutical products. In each case, the actions were filed against many pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers and allege price discrimination and conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of pharmaceutical products. The actions were brought by various pharmacies (both individually and, with respect to certain claims, as a class action) and seek injunctive relief and monetary damages. The Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation ordered these actions coordinated (and, with respect to those actions brought as class actions, consolidated) in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) under the caption &#8220;In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation.&#8221; On November 30, 1998, the defendants remaining in the consolidated federal class action (which proceeded to trial beginning in September 1998), including the Company, were granted a directed verdict by the trial court after the plaintiffs had concluded their case. In ruling in favor of the defendants, the trial judge held that no reasonable jury could reach a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and stated &#8220;the evidence of conspiracy is meager, and the evidence as to individual defendants paltry or non-existent.&#8221; The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit subsequently affirmed the granting of the directed verdict in the federal class case in the Company&#8217;s favor. Following the Seventh Circuit&#8217;s affirmation of the directed verdict in the Company&#8217;s favor, the Company secured the voluntary dismissal of the conspiracy allegations contained in all of the federal cases brought by individual plaintiffs who elected to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of the federal class action, which cases were included in the coordinated proceedings, as well as the dismissal of similar conspiracy and price discrimination

Commitments (In thousands) : Leases: The Company leases manufacturing, office and warehouse facilities, equipment and automobiles under operating leases expiring through fiscal 2018. Rent expense approximated $35,857, $34,630 and $33,149 for fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future minimum rental payments under noncancellable leases are as follows: Years ending March 31, 2010 $ 35,438 2011 28,605 2012 19,162 2013 13,310 2014 12,249 Thereafter 36,469 $ 145,233 Royalty agreements: The Company has royalty agreements on certain of its licensed products. Royalties are paid based on a percentage of sales, as defined. For fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, royalty expense amounted to $616, $1,071 and $4,742, respectively. License agreements: The Company has entered into several license and collaboration agreements for products currently under development. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company may be obligated in future periods to make additional milestone payments totaling approximately $966,000. These milestone payments become due and are payable only upon the achievement of certain research and development (approximately $460,000) and regulatory approval (approximately $506,000) milestones. The specific timing of such milestones cannot be predicted and depend upon future clinical developments as well as regulatory agency actions which cannot be predicted with certainty (including actions which may never occur). Further, under the terms of certain licensing agreements, the Company may be obligated to pay commercial milestones contingent upon the achievement of specific sales levels. Due to the long-range nature of such commercial milestone amounts, they are neither probable at this time nor predictable. Inventory purchase commitments: The Company has inventory purchase commitments of $112,256 as of March 31, 2009.

Stockholders' equity (In thousands, except per share data) : In August 2007, the stockholders of the Company voted to adopt the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (or the 2007 Plan) which replaces and supersedes all prior stock option plans. Under the 2007 Plan, 13,950 shares were authorized to be issued to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries at prices not less than the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant. The 2007 Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and stock equivalent units. These awards generally vest in three to five years. Stock option grants may be exercisable for up to ten years from the date of issuance. The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at March 31, 2009: Options outstanding Options exercisable Range of exercise prices Number outstanding Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) Weighted average exercise price Number exercisable Weighted average exercise price $ 12.29 to $30.00 3,283 6.2 $ 19.86 1,288 $ 13.35 30.01 to 50.00 12,564 4.2 39.74 7,448 39.55 50.01 to 76.66 3,006 4.0 54.18 1,739 55.99 18,853 4.5 38.58 10,475 39.05 Transactions under the stock option plan are summarized as follows: Shares Weighted average exercise price Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Stock options: Outstanding at March 31, 2006 (at $4.55 to $76.66 per share) 24,065 $ 33.98 Granted (at $38.94 to $51.54 per share) 3,859 49.35 Exercised (at $4.55 to $53.23 per share) ( 8,568 ) 24.84 Forfeited ( 1,132 ) 38.90 Outstanding at March 31, 2007 (at $5.64 to $76.66 per share) 18,224 40.91 Granted (at $37.26 to $51.96 per share) 3,248 38.68 Exercised (at $5.64 to $53.23 per share) ( 734 ) 36.68 Forfeited ( 1,444 ) 44.62 Outstanding at March 31, 2008 (at $9.77 to $76.66 per share) 19,294 40.38 Granted (at $20.55 to $38.33 per share) 2,989 28.62 Exercised (at $9.77 to $38.94 per share) ( 715 ) 14.88 Forfeited ( 2,715 ) 46.13 Out

Fair value m easurements (In thousands ) : In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company adopted SFAS 157, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements.&#8221; This pronouncement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather generally applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company&#8217;s market assumptions. SFAS 157 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to fair value measurement techniques into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity&#8217;s own assumptions. The Company&#8217

Upon approval, the Company paid Cypress Bioscience, Inc., its licensor for the product, $25,000. This milestone payment is currently being amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the product and is being recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. In fiscal 2009, the Company entered into two license agreements: the first was with Phenomix Corporation to co-develop and co-promote dutogliptin, a proprietary orally administered, small molecule dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that is being developed for Type II diabetes.

The Company's effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 was higher than the federal statutory rate principally as a result of the in-process R&amp;D expensed as part of the Cerexa acquisition completed in January 2007.

Acquisitions (In thousands) : On January 10, 2007, the Company acquired Cerexa, Inc. (or Cerexa), a biopharmaceutical company based in Oakland, California for approximately $494,000 in a merger pursuant to which Cerexa became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company acquired worldwide development and marketing rights (excluding Japan) to ceftaroline acetate (or ceftaroline), a next generation, broad-spectrum, hospital-based injectable cephalosporin antibiotic. The acquisition of Cerexa also included a second development-stage hospital-based antibiotic, ME1036, which had shown activity against both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in preclinical studies. The Company has discontinued development of the ME1036 compound. The rights to ceftaroline and ME1036 are in-licensed by Cerexa on an exclusive basis from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company and Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd., respectively. The Company will be obligated to pay an additional $100,000 in the event that annual United States sales of ceftaroline exceed $500,000 during the five year period following product launch. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, Cerexa&#8217;s results of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. Of the $494,000 purchase price, $476,000 was assigned as in-process research and development (or IPR&amp;D). Substantially all of this charge represented the value assigned to ceftaroline, which had completed a Phase II clinical trial program in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (or cSSSI). Ceftaroline is being developed initially for the cSSSI indication and the treatment of community acquired pneumonia (or CAP). Phase III studies of ceftaroline for cSSSI began in February 2007. ME1036 was still in preclinical development at the acquisition date. These compounds had not yet achieved regulatory approval for marketing and consequently, the IPR&amp;D was taken as a

The $150.0&#160;million Facility has been restructured as an asset-based loan consisting of a revolving credit facility of $123.0&#160;million (the &#147;Revolver&#148;) and $27.0&#160;million in Term Loans. &nbsp; The $123.0&#160;million Revolver has an interest rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;) plus 4.00% in the case of Eurodollar loans or a base rate plus 3.00% in the case of Base Rate loans.

The Company has not granted stock options with market or performance conditions. The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009 was $1.41. There were no stock options granted during the three months ended March&#160;31, 2008. The weighted-average fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the stock options granted during the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three Months Ended &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March&#160;31, 2009 &nbsp; &nbsp; Expected dividend yield &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.5 % Expected stock price volatility &nbsp; &nbsp; 66.1 % Risk-free interest rate &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.3 % Expected life of options &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&#160;years &nbsp; &nbsp; The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of the Company&#146;s stock in determining the fair value of the stock options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.&#160;Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant and the expected life of the options represents the estimated length of time the options are expected to remain outstanding, which is based on the history of exercises and cancellations of past grants made by the Company. In accordance with SFAS&#160;123(R), the Company recorded compensation expense for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009 and 2008&#160;net of pre-vesting forfeitures for the options granted, which was based on the historical experience of the vest

Shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding adjusted for the assumed exercise of all potentially dilutive stock-based awards. Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each period. The incremental shares from assumed exercise of all potentially dilutive stock options and other stock-based awards are not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009 since their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009 and 2008 excludes the dilutive effect of 2,709,057 and 1,474,109 stock options, respectively, since such options have an exercise price in excess of the average market value of the Company&#146;s common stock during the respective periods. &nbsp; In accordance with EITF Issue No.&#160;04-08, &#147;The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share&#148; (&#147;EITF&#160;04-08&#148;), the weighted-average diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009 and 2008 excluded the effect of 520,000 and 4,058,445&#160;shares that could have been issued upon the conversion of the Company&#146;s convertible subordinated debentures under certain circumstances, since the effects are anti-dilutive to the earnings per share calculation for these periods. &nbsp; The weighted-average basic and diluted shares for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009 include 322,979 of shares that were issued as a result of the stock dividend that was paid to shareholders in February 2009. &nbsp; The following table sets forth the basic and diluted average share amounts: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbs

Based on the analysis, it concluded that the fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount and therefore goodwill was not considered impaired. As of March&#160;31, 2009, the Company&#146;s market capitalization was lower than the market capitalization at December&#160;31, 2008 and lower than the carrying value of the reporting unit as of March&#160;31, 2009 due to declines in the Company&#146;s stock price related in part to the uncertainty surrounding the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility, which was amended and extended on March&#160;31, 2009. Due to the decline in market capitalization, the Company updated its goodwill impairment assessment. The Company considered the increase in stock price and market capitalization subsequent to March&#160;31, 2009 in its assessment since the period subsequent to March&#160;31, 2009 reflects information regarding the amended credit facility. The Company also used a control premium that is within an acceptable range and is reasonable based upon control premiums used in recent industry-wide transactions. Based on its analysis, the Company has concluded that the fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, and therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired as of March&#160;31, 2009. &nbsp; The Company continues to monitor its sto

Marketable Securities The Company classifies its investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders? equity. Marketable securities as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 consist primarily of investments in auction rate securities of approximately $2.9 million. As described in more detail in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company?s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Company?s investments in auction rate securities have a Level 2 fair value measurement classification in accordance with SFAS 157. Uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented the Company and other investors from liquidating some holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions. Accordingly, the Company still holds a portion of these auction rate securities and is receiving interest at comparable rates for similar securities. The Company?s investments in auction rate securities had a par value of approximately $3.1 million as of March 31, 2009, and are insured against loss of principal and interest. Due to the uncertainty in the market as to when these auction rate securities will be refinanced or the auctions will resume, the Company has classified the auction rate securities as noncurrent assets as of March 31, 2009. The total unrealized loss related to its auction rate securities was $167 ($98 after tax), of which $9 ($5 after tax) was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2009.

The Company adopted this FSP during the first quarter of 2009. FSP APB 14-1 requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer&#146;s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. As such, the initial debt proceeds from the sale of the Company&#146;s convertible subordinated debentures, which are discussed in more detail in Note&#160;11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#146;s annual report on Form&#160;10-K for the year ended December&#160;31, 2008, are required to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component as of the debt issuance date. The resulting debt discount is amortized over the instrument&#146;s expected life as additional non-cash interest expense. FSP APB 14-1 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#160;15, 2008 and requires retrospective application. &nbsp; Upon adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Company measured the fair value of the Company&#146;s $75.0&#160;million 5%&#160;Convertible Subordinated Debentures (&#147;Notes&#148;) issued in September 2003, using an interest rate that the Company could have obtained at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without an embedded conversion option. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that the fair value of the Notes was approximately $61.7&#160;million as of the issuance date, a reduction of approximately $13.3&#160;million in the carrying value of the Notes, of which $8.2&#160;million was recorded as additional paid-in capital, and $5.1&#160;million was recorded as a deferred tax liability. Also in accordance with FSP APB 14-1, the Company is required to allocate a portion of the $3.3&#160;million of debt issuance costs that were directly related to the is

Segment profit is defined as gross profit (revenue less cost of revenue) less selling and administrative expenses. Segment performance is evaluated exclusive of interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, integration and asset impairment charges, and other expenses and other income. Segment profit is measured because management believes that such information is useful in evaluating the Company&#146;s results relative to other entities that operate within our industry. Segment profit is also used as the primary financial measure for purposes of evaluating financial performance under the Company&#146;s annual incentive plan. The information presented below reconciles segment profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three Months Ended &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March&#160;31, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2009 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2008 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Unaudited) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (In thousands) &nbsp; &nbsp; Revenue &nbsp; $ 169,105 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 208,767 &nbsp; Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) &nbsp; &nbsp; (110,070 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; (138,163 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross profit &nbsp; &nbsp; 59,035 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 70,604 &nbsp; Selling and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) &nbsp; &nbsp; (46,085 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; (57,962 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Segment profit &nbsp; &nbsp; 12,950 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12,642 &

The Company took several steps over the past several years to reduce fixed costs, eliminate redundancies and better position the Company to respond to market pressures or unfavorable economic conditions. As a result of these steps, the Company incurred restructuring charges for severance and personnel-related costs related to headcount reductions and costs associated with closing down and consolidating facilities. &nbsp; During the first quarter of 2009, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 200 positions, or 6% of the Company&#146;s total headcount. The reduction in workforce was a continuation of the cost savings initiatives implemented during 2008 and included a broad range of functions and was enterprise-wide. The Company recorded approximately $4.3&#160;million of severance related costs associated with the workforce reductions for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2009. In addition, the Company incurred costs of approximately $0.8&#160;million related primarily to costs associated with the closure of the Company&#146;s facility in Dominguez Hills, CA and its digital print facilities in Kent, WA and Dallas, TX. These facilities are expected to be closed during the second quarter of 2009. &nbsp; The Company recorded integration costs of approximately $1.1&#160;million during the first quarter of 2009, primarily related to the Company&#146;s recent acquisitions which are discussed in more detail in Note&#160;2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company&#146;s annual report on Form&#160;10-K for the year ended December&#160;31, 2008.

The primary risk managed by the Company&#146;s use of commodity derivative contracts is commodity price risk. These derivative contracts allow the Company to limit its exposure to a portion of its projected natural gas and crude oil sales. None of the Company&#146;s derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features. At March&#160;31, 2009 and December&#160;31, 2008, the Company&#146;s commodity derivative contracts consisted of fixed price swaps and basis swaps, which are included in the derivative descriptions below: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fixed price swaps &nbsp; The Company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to the counterparty over a specified period for a contracted volume. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Collars &nbsp; Contain a fixed floor price (put) and a fixed ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, the Company receives the fixed price and pays the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, no payments are due from either party. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basis swaps &nbsp; The Company receives a payment from the counterparty if the settled price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the settled price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract which guarantees the Company a price differential for natural gas from a specified delivery point. &nbsp; In January 2008, the Company entered into a $350.0&#160;million notional interest rate swap agreement to fix the variable LIBOR interest rate on its floating rate senior term loan at 6.26% per annum for the period April&#160;1, 2008 to April&#160;1, 2011 to manage the interest rate risk on a portion of its floating rate debt.

Effective January&#160;1, 2009, the Company implemented SFAS&#160;No.&#160;157 for certain nonfinancial liabilities based on FSP&#160;157-2, which delayed the effective date of SFAS&#160;No.&#160;157 by one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities, with no material impact to the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations as a result of this implementation. SFAS&#160;No.&#160;157 applies to all assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis. &nbsp; As defined in SFAS&#160;No.&#160;157, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS&#160;No.&#160;157 requires disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. The statement requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: &nbsp; Level&#160;1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. &nbsp; Level&#160;2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. &nbsp; Level&#160;3: Measurement based on prices or valuation models that required inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable for objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). &nbsp; As required by SFAS&#160;No.&#160;157, assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Impairment Full Cost Ceiling Limitation. Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of natural gas and crude oil properties, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated ?ceiling.? The ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated after-tax future net revenue from proved natural gas and crude oil properties, excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations included in the net book value of natural gas and crude oil properties, plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization. In calculating future net revenues, prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate period. These prices are not changed except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts. The Company has entered into various commodity derivative contracts; however, these derivative contracts are not accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effect of these derivative contracts has not been considered in calculating the full cost ceiling limitation as of March 31, 2009. The net book value, less related deferred tax liabilities, is compared to the ceiling limitation on a quarterly and annual basis. Any excess of the net book value, less related deferred taxes, is written off as an expense. An expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling limitation in the subsequent period. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company reduced the carrying value of its oil and gas properties by $1,304.4 million due to the full cost ceiling limitation.

The subsidiary guarantees (i)&#160;rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior debt of the subsidiary guarantors; (ii)&#160;rank senior to all of the existing and future subordinated debt of the subsidiary guarantors; (iii)&#160;are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any existing or future secured obligations of the subsidiary guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations; and (iv)&#160;are structurally subordinated to all debt and other obligations of the subsidiaries of the guarantors who are not themselves guarantors. &nbsp; The Company has not presented separate financial and narrative information for each of the subsidiary guarantors because it believes that such financial and narrative information would not provide any additional information that would be material in evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees. &nbsp; The following condensed consolidating financial information represents the financial information of SandRidge Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary guarantors, prepared on the equity basis of accounting. The non-guarantor subsidiaries are minor and, therefore, not presented separately.

Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average shares outstanding during the period, but also include the dilutive effect of awards of restricted stock. The following table summarizes the calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three-month periods ended March 31 (in thousands): &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2009 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2008 &nbsp; &nbsp; Weighted average basic common shares outstanding &nbsp; &nbsp; 163,321 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 141,044 &nbsp; Effect of dilutive securities: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Restricted stock &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weighted average diluted common and potential common shares outstanding &nbsp; &nbsp; 163,321 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 141,044 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the three-month periods ended March&#160;31, 2009 and 2008, restricted stock awards covering 4.2&#160;million shares and 2.2&#160;million shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of net loss per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. &nbsp; In computing diluted earnings per share, the Company evaluated the if-converted method with respect to its outstanding 8.5% convertible perpetual preferred stock for the three-month period ended March&#160;31, 2009 and with respect to its outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock for the three-month period ended March&#160;31, 2008. Under this method, the Company assumes the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock and determines if this is more dilutive than including the preferred stock dividends (paid and unpaid) in the computation of income

Certain reclassifications have been made in prior period financial statements to conform with current period presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (?SFAS?) No. 157, ?Fair Value Measurements,? for its financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. See Note 3. In October 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (?FASB?) issued Staff Position FAS 157-3, ?Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active,? (?FSP 157-3?) which was effective upon issuance. FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. As of March 31, 2009, the Company had no financial assets with a market that was not active. Accordingly, FSP 157-3 had no effect on the Company?s current financial statements. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company implemented SFAS No. 157 for certain of its nonfinancial liabilities, in accordance with Staff Position FAS 157-2, ?Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157? (?FSP 157-2?), which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, at least annually. This implementation did not have a material impact on the Company?s financial position or results of operations. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company implemented SFAS No. 160, ?Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements ? an Amendment of Account

The offering included 400,000&#160;shares of convertible perpetual preferred stock issued upon the full exercise of the initial purchaser&#146;s option to cover over-allotments. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $243.3&#160;million after deducting offering expenses of approximately $8.6&#160;million. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes. &nbsp; Each share of 8.5% convertible perpetual preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share and is convertible at the holder&#146;s option at any time initially into approximately 12.4805&#160;shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Each holder of the convertible perpetual preferred stock is entitled to an annual dividend of $8.50 to be paid semi-annually in cash, common stock or a combination thereof at the Company&#146;s election with the first dividend payment due in February 2010. The convertible perpetual preferred stock is not redeemable by the Company at any time.

Costs in Excess of Billings (Billings in Excess of Costs Incurred) In June 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (?Occidental?) to construct a CO 2 treating plant (the ?Century Plant?) and associated compression and pipeline facilities for $800.0 million. Occidental will pay a minimum of 100% of the contract price, plus any subsequent agreed-upon revisions, to the Company through periodic cost reimbursements based upon the percentage of the project completed. Upon start-up, the Century Plant, located in Pecos County, Texas, will be owned and operated by Occidental for the purpose of separating and removing CO 2 from natural gas delivered by the Company. Pursuant to a 30-year treating agreement executed simultaneously with the construction agreement, Occidental will remove CO 2 from the Company?s delivered natural gas. The Company will retain all methane gas from the Century Plant and its other existing plants. The Company accounts for construction of the Century Plant using the completed-contract method, under which contract revenues and costs are recognized when work under the contract is completed or substantially completed. In the interim, costs incurred on and billings related to contracts in process are accumulated on the balance sheet. Provisions for a contract loss are recognized when it is determined that a loss will be incurred. Costs in excess of billings (billings in excess of costs incurred) were $16.2 million and ($14.1) million and were reported as a current asset and current liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. During April 2009, the Company issued and received payment for a progress billing in the amount of $42.2 million.

Under the Credit Facility, outstanding balances accrue interest at 50.0 to 100.0 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other bank-developed rates, at our option.&nbsp; The commitment fee on the unused balance ranges from 12.5 to 20.0 basis points. The increment over LIBOR and the commitment fee are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined. The remaining availability under our line of credit, reduced for certain outstanding letters of credit, approximated $51.6 million and $31.1 million as of March&nbsp;29, 2009 and December&nbsp;28, 2008, respectively. The fair value of our outstanding debt approximates the carrying value since our debt agreements are variable-rate instruments. &nbsp; The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified fixed charges and leverage ratios. At March&nbsp;29, 2009 and December&nbsp;28, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants. &nbsp; We presently have two interest rate swap agreements (&#147;swaps&#148;) that provide fixed interest ra

SFAS No.&nbsp;157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 in two phases: (1)&nbsp;phase one was effective for financial assets and liabilities in our first quarter of 2008 and (2)&nbsp;phase two was effective for our first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;157 in 2008 and 2009 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. &nbsp; SFAS No.&nbsp;141R, Business Combinations &nbsp; Papa John&#146;s adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;141 - revised 2007 (SFAS No.&nbsp;141R), Business Combinations, in the first quarter of 2009. SFAS No.&nbsp;141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No.&nbsp;141R applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December&nbsp;15, 2008. The adoption of this statement had no impact on our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2009. &nbsp; SFAS No.&nbsp;160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp; Papa John&#146;s adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial

A variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE&#146;s assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about VIEs that the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. &nbsp; We have a purchasing arrangement w

The domestic commissary segment consists of the operations of our regional dough production and product distribution centers and derives its revenues principally from the sale and distribution of food and paper products to domestic Company-owned and franchised restaurants. The domestic franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support activities and derives its revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and collection of royalties from our domestic franchisees. The international operations segment principally consists of our Company-owned restaurants and distribution sales to franchised Papa John&#146;s restaurants located in the United Kingdom, China and Mexico and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our international franchisees. VIEs consist of entities in which we are deemed the primary beneficiary, as defined in Note 3, and include BIBP and certain franchisees to which we have extended loans. All other business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments consist of operations that derive revenues from the sale, principally to Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of printing and promotional items, risk management services, and information systems and related services used in restaurant operations. &nbsp; Generally, we evaluate performance and a

Under the Financing Agreement, Rosenthal made a term loan in the principal amount of $2,500 to the Company and has additionally agreed to provide up to an additional $2,500 under a revolving line of credit. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Financing Agreement is payable at variable rates of interest over the published JPMorgan Chase prime rate (with a minimum prime rate of 6%), 2.5% on the term loan and 2% on borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The Company
s obligations under the term loan are evidenced by a secured Term Note and all of the Company

The Financing Agreement, as amended most recently on March 13, 2009, terminates on March 30, 2011 unless sooner terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the Financing Agreement. The terms include a provision that would allow the lender to accelerate the due date of the debt based on certain circumstances. The Company is required to maintain certain levels of working capital and tangible net worth. On April 22, 2008, these amounts were amended effective as of December 31, 2007. On March 13, 2009, these amounts were amended effective as of December 31, 2008. The Company was in compliance with the amended terms at March 31, 2009.

s estimated economic useful life to cost of revenues. Net capitalized software development costs (included in other assets) totaled $416 and $361 at December 31, 2008 and March, 31, 2009, respectively. Related amortization expense, included in cost of revenues, totaled $55 for both the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2009. The Company capitalizes internal-use software development costs in accordance with Statement of Position (
) No. 98-1 (
SOP 98-1
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
 SOP 98-1 requires that entities capitalize certain internal-use software costs once certain criteria are met. Once the internal-use software is ready for its intended use, the capitalized internal-use software costs will be amortized over the related software
s estimated economic useful life in amortization and depreciation expense. Our computer software is also subject to review for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the amount of the asset reflected in the Company
s balance sheet may not be recoverable. Net capitalized internal-use software costs (included in property and equipment) were $725 and $1,107 at December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, respectively.

FSP 157-4 does not change the definition of fair value as detailed in SFAS 157, but provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS 157 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. The provisions of FSP 157-4 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009.

). Stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2009 was recognized in the following income statement expenses: Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 2009 Cost of revenues $ 12 $ 11 Sales and marketing 73 111 Product development 39 35 General and administrative 159 308 Total stock compensation expense $ 283 $ 465 This expense increased the Company
s net loss per share by $0.01 and $0.02 in the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The estimated per share weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2009 were $1.96 and $1.01, respectively. Amounts were determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model based on the following assumptions: Three Months Ended March 31, 2008 2009 Expected dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % Expected volatility 76.51 % 74.46 % Risk-free interest rate 3.82 % 2.04 % Expected life in years 6 6 The assumptions used in calculating the value of stock options, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment, were based on the following: " Expected dividend yield 
reflects the Company
s present intention to retain earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of the Company
s business; " Expected volatility 
determined considering historical volatility of the Company
s common stock over the preceding six years; " Risk-free interest rate 
based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the stock option awards; and " Expected life

Diluted earnings per share reflects, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted and resulted in the issuance of common stock. Diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share amounts, as the outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock grants and warrants are anti-dilutive for each of the periods presented. At March 31, 2008 and 2009, the number of anti-dilutive securities outstanding were 3,485,400 and 3,952,797, respectively.

ICU Medical, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Medegen alleged that ICU Medical infringed one of its patents by offering for sale and selling the CLC2000 and TEGO. Medegen sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. In March 2007, Medegen withdrew its action as to the TEGO. On June 21, 2007, the Court issued an order interpreting certain terms and phrases of Medegen's patent in a manner that we believe supported our position. On September 14, 2007, the Court issued an order granting our summary judgment motion of non-infringement and On October 19, 2007, entered judgment of non-infringement, dismissing Medegen's case with prejudice. On October 19, 2007, the Court also dismissed, without prejudice, our counterclaims that the asserted patent is invalid and unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by Medegen before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Medegen has appealed the Court's claim construction and summary judgment orders. By decision issued in November 2008, the Federal Circuit reversed the order granting summary judgment and remanded the case to the District Court. The Company intends to defend itself against Medegen's claims in this action. The outcome of this action is uncertain, therefore no accrual has been recorded. The Company is from time to time involved in various other legal proceedings, most of which are routine litigation, in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution of the other legal proceedings in which the Company is involved will not likely have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In the normal course of business, the Company has agreed to indemnify officers and directors of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law and to indemnify customers as to certain intellectual property matters related to sales of the Company's

The Company has $61.7 million of its investment securities as Level 2 assets, which are pre-refunded municipal securities and have observable inputs. The Company has $11.7 million invested in "auction rate securities" and $0.4 million in put option assets related to the auction rate securities as Level 3 assets due to the unobservable inputs caused by the lack of liquidity in the recent auctions. The valuation of these securities was based on quotes received from our brokers which were derived from their internal models combined with internally developed discount factors. In determining a discount factor for each auction rate security, the model weights various factors, including assessments of credit quality, duration, insurance wraps, discount rates, overall capital market liquidity and comparable securities, if any.

Under the new guidance, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies should be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be determined during the measurement period. If fair value cannot be determined, companies should typically account for the acquired contingencies using existing guidance. The Company adopted FAS 141(R) and FSP SFAS 141(R)-1 on January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-4, "Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly" which provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements", when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. This FSP also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly . This pronouncement is effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company's management does not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 115-2 and SFAS 124-2, "Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments", to amend the other-than-temporary impairment guidance in debt securities to be based on intent to sell instead of ability to hold the security an

COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES      (A)     GUARANTEES AND OTHER ASSURANCES  As part of normal business activities, FirstEnergy enters into variousagreements on behalf of its subsidiaries to provide financial or performanceassurances to third parties. These agreements include contract guarantees,surety bonds and LOCs. As of March 31, 2009, outstanding guarantees and otherassurances aggregated approximately $4.5 billion, consisting of parentalguarantees - $1.2 billion, subsidiaries' guarantees - $2.6 billion, surety bonds- $0.1 billion and LOCs - $0.6 billion. FirstEnergy guarantees energy and energy-related payments of its subsidiariesinvolved in energy commodity activities principally to facilitate or hedgenormal physical transactions involving electricity, gas, emission allowances andcoal. FirstEnergy also provides guarantees to various providers of creditsupport for the financing or refinancing by subsidiaries of costs related to theacquisition of property, plant and equipment. These agreements obligateFirstEnergy to fulfill the obligations of those subsidiaries directly involvedin energy and energy-related transactions or financing where the law mightotherwise limit the counterparties' claims. If demands of a counterparty were toexceed the ability of a subsidiary to satisfy existing obligations, FirstEnergy's guarantee enables the counterparty's legal claim to be satisfiedby other FirstEnergy assets. The likelihood is remote that such parentalguarantees of $0.4 billion (included in the $1.2 billion discussed above) as ofMarch 31, 2009 would increase amounts otherwise payable by FirstEnergy to meetits obligations incurred in connection with financings and ongoing energy andenergy-related activities. While these types of guarantees are normally parental commitments for the futurepayment of subsidiary obligations, subsequent to the occurrence of a creditrating downgrade or "material adverse event," the immediate posting of cashcollateral, provision of an LOC or accelerated payments may be required

DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS FirstEnergy  is  exposed  to financial risks resulting from fluctuating interest rates  and commodity prices, including prices for electricity, natural gas, coal and  energy  transmission. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, FirstEnergy  uses  a  variety  of  derivative  instruments,  including  forward contracts,  options,  futures  contracts and swaps. The derivatives are used for risk  management  purposes.  In addition to derivatives, FirstEnergy also enters into  master  netting  agreements with certain third parties. FirstEnergy's Risk Policy  Committee,  comprised  of members of senior management, provides general management oversight for risk management activities throughout FirstEnergy. They are  responsible  for promoting the effective design and implementation of sound risk  management  programs.  They  also  oversee  compliance with corporate risk management  policies  and  established  risk  management  practices. FirstEnergy  accounts  for  derivative  instruments  on its Consolidated Balance Sheet  at their fair value unless they meet the normal purchase and normal sales criteria.  Derivatives  that  meet those criteria are accounted for at cost. The changes  in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sales criteria are recorded as other expense, as AOCL, or as part  of  the  value  of  the  hedged  item  as  described  below.      Interest  Rate  Derivatives Under  the  revolving  credit  facility,  FirstEnergy  incurs  variable interest charges  based on LIBOR. In 2008, FirstEnergy entered into swaps with a notional value  of  $200  million  to hedge against changes in associated interest rates. Hedges  with  a  notional  value of $100 million expire in November 2009 and the remainder  expire  in  November  2010.  The swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. As of March 31, 2009, the fair value of outstanding swaps was  $(4)  million. FirstEnergy  uses  forward  starting  swap  agreem

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS FirstEnergy  provides  noncontributory  qualified  defined benefit pension plans that  cover  substantially  all of its employees and non-qualified pension plans that  cover certain employees. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of  service  and  compensation  levels. FirstEnergy's funding policy is based on actuarial  computations using the projected unit credit method. FirstEnergy uses a  December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  The  fair value of the plan assets represents the actual market value as of  December  31.  FirstEnergy also provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life insurance to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance.  Health  care benefits, which include certain employee contributions, deductibles  and  co-payments,  are available upon retirement to employees hired prior  to  January  1,  2005, their dependents and, under certain circumstances, their  survivors.  FirstEnergy recognizes the expected cost of providing pension benefits  and  other  postretirement  benefits from the time employees are hired until  they  become eligible to receive those benefits. In addition, FirstEnergy has  obligations  to  former  or inactive employees after employment, but before retirement,  for  disability-related  benefits. For  the  three  months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, FirstEnergy's net pension and  OPEB expense (benefit) was $43 million and $(15) million, respectively. The components  of  FirstEnergy's  net pension and other postretirement benefit cost (including  amounts  capitalized)  for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008,  consisted  of  the  following:             PENSION BENEFITS          OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS            ----------------          -----------------------------                  2009          2008          2009          2008                  ----          ----                        ----                                  (IN MILLI

INCOME TAXES FirstEnergy  accounts  for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements in accordance with FIN 48. This interpretation prescribes a recognition  threshold  and  measurement  attribute  for  financial  statement recognition  and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a company's  tax  return.  Upon  completion of the federal tax examination for the 2007  tax  year in the first quarter of 2009, FirstEnergy recognized $13 million in  tax  benefits,  which  favorably  affected FirstEnergy's effective tax rate. During  the  first  three  months  of  2008,  there  were no material changes to FirstEnergy's  unrecognized  tax  benefits.  As  of  March 31, 2009, FirstEnergy expects  that  it  is  reasonably possible that $193 million of the unrecognized benefits  may  be resolved within the next twelve months, of which approximately $148  million, if recognized, would affect FirstEnergy's effective tax rate. The potential  decrease  in  the  amount  of  unrecognized tax benefits is primarily associated with issues related to the capitalization of certain costs, gains and losses  recognized  on  the  disposition  of assets and various other tax items.  FIN  48  also requires companies to recognize interest expense or income related to  uncertain  tax positions. That amount is computed by applying the applicable statutory interest rate to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance  with  FIN 48 and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken on  the  tax  return.  FirstEnergy  includes  net  interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes. The net amount of accumulated interest accrued as of March  31,  2009  was $61 million, as compared to $59 million as of December 31, 2008.  During  the  first  three months of 2009 and 2008, there were no material changes  to  the  amount  of  interest  accrued. FirstEnergy  has tax returns that are under review at the audit or appeals level by  the  IRS  and  state  tax authoritie

EARNINGS  PER  SHARE Basic  earnings per share of common stock is computed using the weighted average of  actual  common  shares  outstanding  during  the  respective  period  as the denominator.

ORGANIZATION  AND  BASIS  OF  PRESENTATION FirstEnergy  is a diversified energy company that holds, directly or indirectly, all  of the outstanding common stock of its principal subsidiaries: OE, CEI, TE, Penn (a wholly owned subsidiary of OE), ATSI, JCP&L, Met-Ed, Penelec, FENOC, FES and  its  subsidiaries  FGCO  and  NGC,  and  FESC. FirstEnergy  and  its  subsidiaries follow GAAP and comply with the regulations, orders,  policies  and  practices  prescribed  by  the  SEC,  the  FERC  and, as applicable,  the  PUCO,  the  PPUC  and  the NJBPU. The preparation of financial statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  periodic estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets, liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  and  disclosure  of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual  results  could  differ  from these estimates. The reported results of operations are not indicative of results of operations for any future period. These statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes  included  in  the  combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December  31,  2008  for  FirstEnergy,  FES  and the Utilities. The consolidated unaudited  financial  statements  of  FirstEnergy, FES and each of the Utilities reflect all normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary  to  fairly  present  results  of  operations for the interim periods. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  defined terms used herein have the meanings  set  forth  in  the  accompanying  Glossary  of  Terms. FirstEnergy  and  its  subsidiaries  consolidate all majority-owned subsidiaries over  which  they exercise control and, when applicable, entities for which they have  a  controlling  financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances are  eliminated  in  consolidation.  FirstEnergy consolidates a VIE (see Note 6) when  it  is

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS FSP  FAS  157-4  - "Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for  the  Asset  or  Liability  Have  Significantly  Decreased  and  Identifying Transactions  That  Are  Not  Orderly" In  April  2009,  the  FASB  issued  Staff  Position  FAS  157-4, which provides additional  guidance  to consider in estimating fair value when there has been a significant  decrease  in  market  activity  for  a  financial  asset.  The  FSP establishes  a  two-step process requiring a reporting entity to first determine if  a  market is not active in relation to normal market activity for the asset. If  evidence  indicates  the  market is not active, an entity would then need to determine  whether  a quoted price in the market is associated with a distressed transaction.  An  entity will need to further analyze the transactions or quoted prices,  and an adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to  estimate  fair  value.  Additional  disclosures  related  to  the inputs and valuation  techniques used in the fair value measurements are also required. The FSP is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early  adoption  permitted  for periods ending after March 15, 2009. FirstEnergy will  adopt  the  FSP for its interim period ending June 30, 2009. While the FSP will expand disclosure requirements, FirstEnergy does not expect the FSP to have a  material  effect  upon  its  financial  statements.      FSP  FAS  115-2  and  FAS  124-2  -  "Recognition  and  Presentation  of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairments" In  April  2009,  the  FASB issued Staff Position FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, which changes  the  method  to  determine  whether  an other-than-temporary impairment exists  for  debt  securities  and  the  amount  of impairment to be recorded in earnings.  Under the FSP, management will be required to assert it does not have the intent to sell the debt security, and it is more likely than not it will not have  to s

FAIR  VALUE  MEASURES FirstEnergy's valuation techniques, including the three levels of the fair value hierarchy  as  defined  by  SFAS  157,  are  disclosed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  FirstEnergy's  Annual  Report. The  following  table  sets  forth  FirstEnergy's financial assets and financial liabilities  that are accounted for at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

SEGMENT  INFORMATION FirstEnergy  has  three reportable operating segments: energy delivery services, competitive  energy  services  and  Ohio  transitional  generation services. The assets and revenues for all other business operations are below the quantifiable threshold  for  operating  segments  for  separate  disclosure  as  "reportable operating  segments." The energy delivery services segment designs, constructs, operates and maintains FirstEnergy's regulated transmission and distribution systems and is responsible for  the regulated generation commodity operations of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania and New Jersey electric utility subsidiaries. Its revenues are primarily derived from  the  delivery  of  electricity,  cost  recovery  of regulatory assets, and default  service  electric  generation  sales  to  non-shopping customers in its Pennsylvania  and  New Jersey franchise areas. Its results reflect the commodity costs  of  securing  electric  generation  from  FES  under partial requirements purchased  power  agreements  and from non-affiliated power suppliers as well as the  net  PJM  transmission  expenses related to the delivery of that generation load. The  competitive energy services segment supplies electric power to its electric utility  affiliates,  provides  competitive electricity sales primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania,  Maryland  and Michigan, owns or leases and operates FirstEnergy's generating  facilities  and purchases electricity to meet its sales obligations. The  segment's  net  income is primarily derived from the affiliated company PSA sales and the non-affiliated electric generation sales revenues less the related costs  of electricity generation, including purchased power and net transmission (including  congestion)  and  ancillary costs charged by PJM and MISO to deliver electricity  to  the  segment's  customers.  The  segment's  internal  revenues represent  the  affiliated  company  PSA  sales. The  Ohio  transitional  generation  services  segment  represents the regulated gen

VARIABLE  INTEREST  ENTITIES FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries consolidate VIEs when they are determined to be the  VIE's primary beneficiary as defined by FIN 46R. Effective January 1, 2009, FirstEnergy  adopted  SFAS  160.  As  a result, FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries reflect  the  portion  of  VIEs  not owned by them in the caption noncontrolling interest  within  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  change  in noncontrolling  interest within the Consolidated Balance Sheets is the result of earnings and losses of the noncontrolling interests and distributions to owners.  MINING  OPERATIONS  On  July  16, 2008, FEV entered into a joint venture with the Boich Companies, a Columbus,  Ohio-based  coal  company,  to acquire a majority stake in the Signal Peak mining and coal transportation operations near Roundup, Montana. FEV made a $125  million  equity investment in the joint venture, which acquired 80% of the mining  operations  (Signal  Peak  Energy,  LLC)  and 100% of the transportation operations,  with  FEV  owning  a  45% economic interest and an affiliate of the Boich  Companies  owning  a  55%  economic  interest  in the joint venture. Both parties  have  a  50%  voting  interest in the joint venture. In March 2009, FEV agreed  to  pay a total of $8.5 million (of which $1.7 million was paid in March 2009) to affiliates of the Boich Companies to purchase an additional 5% economic interest  in  the  Signal Peak mining and coal transportation operations. Voting interests  will  remain  unchanged  after  the  sale  is completed in July 2009. Effective January 16, 2010, the joint venture will have 18 months to exercise an option  to  acquire  the  remaining  20%  stake  in  the  mining  operations. In accordance  with  FIN  46R,  FEV  consolidates  the  mining  and  transportation operations  of  this  joint  venture  in  its  financial  statements.  TRUSTS  FirstEnergy's  consolidated  financial statements include PNBV and Shippingport, VIEs created in 1996 and 1997, respectively, to refinanc

REGULATORY MATTERS      (A) RELIABILITY INITIATIVES  In 2005, Congress amended the Federal Power Act to provide forfederally-enforceable mandatory reliability standards. The mandatory reliabilitystandards apply to the bulk power system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting requirements on the Utilities and ATSI. The NERC ischarged with establishing and enforcing these reliability standards, although ithas delegated day-to-day implementation and enforcement of its responsibilitiesto eight regional entities, including ReliabilityFirst Corporation. All ofFirstEnergy's facilities are located within the ReliabilityFirst region.FirstEnergy actively participates in the NERC and ReliabilityFirst stakeholderprocesses, and otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to theongoing development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability standards. FirstEnergy believes that it is in compliance with all currently-effective andenforceable reliability standards. Nevertheless, it is clear that the NERC,ReliabilityFirst and the FERC will continue to refine existing reliabilitystandards as well as to develop and adopt new reliability standards. Thefinancial impact of complying with new or amended standards cannot be determinedat this time. However, the 2005 amendments to the Federal Power Act provide thatall prudent costs incurred to comply with the new reliability standards berecovered in rates. Still, any future inability on FirstEnergy's part to complywith the reliability standards for its bulk power system could result in theimposition of financial penalties and thus have a material adverse effect on itsfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In April 2007, ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit ofFirstEnergy's bulk-power system within the MISO region and found it to be infull compliance with all audited reliability standards. Similarly, in October2008, ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit of FirstEnergy'sbulk-power system within the

The Company determines fair value of such awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used to value Safeway
s first-quarter grants, by year, are as follows: 2009 2008 Expected life (in years) 6.5 4.5 Expected stock volatility 40.2 % 32.6 % Risk-free interest rate 2.35 % 2.83 % Expected dividend yield during the expected term 1.3 % 0.8 % In 2009, the Company issued options with a longer term than had been used for prior years
 grants. Because not enough time has passed to provide the Company with sufficient data on the exercise behavior of employees who were granted these 2009 options, the expected life of the 2009 options was determined using the 
simplified method
 stated in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 that utilizes the following formula: ((vesting term + original contract term)/2). The Company calculated the expected life of 2008 options based upon its historical data. Expected stock volatility was determined based upon a combination of historical volatility for the 6.5-year-period and 4.5-year-period for 2009 and 2008, respectively, preceding the measurement date and estimates of implied volatility based on open interests in traded option contracts on Safeway common stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield curve in effect at the time the options were granted, using U.S. constant maturities over the expected life of the option. Expected dividend yield is based on Safeway
s dividend policy at the time the options were granted.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company adopted SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities beginning in fiscal 2008 and for nonfinancial assets and liabilities beginning in fiscal 2009. SFAS No. 157 prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing. As of March 28, 2009, Safeway held various short-term investments with a fair value of $33.0 million measured at Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company maintains a rabbi trust to fund a deferred compensation plan. Investments in the trust are included in other long-term assets at fair value and categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. As of March 28, 2009, the fair value of these investments was approximately $17.0 million. Long-lived assets and store lease exit costs were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of long-lived assets and store lease exit costs are determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows (including rental expense for leased properties, sublease rental income, common area maintenance costs and real estate taxes) and discounting them using a risk-adjusted rate of interest. Safeway estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located and, when necessary, uses real estate brokers. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, 
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
 certain long-lived assets with a carrying value of $18.2 million were written down to their fair value of $7.1 million, resulting in an impairment charge of

The recognition of these items is primarily due to the settlement of a federal income tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (
) and the completion of the IRS examination of the Company
s tax returns for 2004 and 2005 during the first quarter of 2009. On April 29, 2009, the Company was notified by the IRS that it approved a settlement of another disputed income tax matter. The result will be a reduction in income tax expense by an estimated $50 million during the second quarter of 2009. After considering this subsequent event, the remaining unrecognized tax benefits are approximately $65 million of which $34 million may affect the effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months.

Safeway
 or the 
Company
) for the 12 weeks ended March 28, 2009 and March 22, 2008 are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, contain all adjustments that are of a normal and recurring nature necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations for such periods. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (
). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to SEC regulations. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the Company
s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the 12 weeks ended March 28, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. Inventory Net income reflects the LIFO method of valuing certain domestic inventories based upon estimated annual inflation. The LIFO method of inventory valuation can only be determined annually, when inflation rates and inventory levels are known; therefore, LIFO inventory costs for interim financial statements are estimated. Actual LIFO inflation indices for the year are calculated during the fourth quarter based upon a statistical sampling of inventories. Safeway recorded LIFO expense of $1.4 million during the first 12 weeks of 2009 and $5.4 million during the first 12 weeks of 2008. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances totaled $629.8 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $622.1 million for the first quarter of 2008. Vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories: promotional allowances, slot

Commitments and Contingencies Praxair is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Praxair has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company
s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company
s reported results of operations in any given period (see Note 18 of the 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K). Among such matters are: " Claims brought by welders alleging that exposure to manganese contained in welding fumes caused neurological injury. Praxair has never manufactured welding consumables. Such products were manufactured prior to 1985 by a predecessor company of Praxair. As of March 31, 2009, Praxair was a co-defendant with many other companies in lawsuits alleging personal injury caused by manganese contained in welding fumes. There were a total of 1,801 individual claimants in these cases. The cases were pending in several state and federal courts. The federal cases have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for coordinated pretrial proceedings. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and, in most instances, punitive damages. In the past, Praxair has either been dismissed from the cases with no payment or has settled a few cases for nominal amounts. Various class actions have been proposed but none have been certified. No reserves have been recorded for these cases as management does not believe that a loss from them is probable or reasonably estimable.

Financial Instruments In its normal operations, Praxair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and to a lesser extent precious metal prices. The objective of financial risk management at Praxair is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company
s earnings, and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Praxair routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (
derivatives
) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, currency-swap agreements, forward contracts, currency options, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Praxair only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. There are two types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, and (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; while cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions. When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge or a cash-flow hedge. Currently, Praxair designates all interest-rate, treasury rate lock and commodity-swap agreements as hedges for accounting purposes; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes unless they are related to forecasted transactions. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effe

Share-Based Compensation The company accounts for share-based compensation under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised 2004), 
Share-Based Payment
 (SFAS No. 123R). Share-based compensation of $9 million ($6 million after tax) and $11 million ($8 million after tax) was recognized during the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The expense was primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. There was no share-based compensation cost that was capitalized. For further details regarding Praxair
s share-based compensation arrangements and prior year grants, refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair
s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Beginning in 2009, the company changed the components of its long-term incentives awarded to employees. The company increased the amount of restricted and performance-based stock and decreased the amount of stock options granted to employees. Stock Options The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $8.05 ($11.53 in 2008) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants in 2009 and 2008: Quarter ended March 31, 2009 2008 Dividend yield 2.6 % 1.8 % Volatility 18.7 % 13.9 % Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % 3.0 % Expected term in years 5 5 The following table summarizes option activity under the plans as of March 31, 2009 and changes during the period then ended (averages are calculated on a weighted basis; life in years; intrinsic value expressed in millions): Activity Number of Options (000

At March 31, 2009, 1,307 of these positions have been eliminated. The remaining actions are planned to be completed through 2009 primarily as businesses are sold or shut down. Other charges of $59 million reflected recent developments related primarily to social tax matters in Brazil. The following table summarizes the activity related to the company

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Presentation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - In the opinion of Praxair, Inc. (Praxair) management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements of Praxair, Inc. and subsidiaries in Praxair
s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the company
s significant accounting policies during 2009. Accounting Standards Implemented in 2009 The following standards were all effective for Praxair on January 1, 2009: " SFAS No. 160, 
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements
 requires noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) in subsidiaries to be classified as a separate component of equity in the consolidated financial statements. The new standard also requires the amounts of net income and comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interests to be included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of income and comprehensive income, respectively, and requires various additional disclosures related to noncontrolling interests. SFAS No. 160 requires changes in ownership interest that result either in consolidation or deconsolidation to be recorded at fair value through earnings, including the retained ownership interest, while changes that do not result in either consolidation or deconsolidation of a subsidiary are treated as equity transactions. Also, in accordance with the transition provisions, prior year
s presentations and disclosures have been retrospectively adjusted to conform with SFAS No. 160. Effective in 2009, transactions with noncontrolling interests are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with SFAS No. 160. " SFAS No.

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
. The FSP was issued in May 2008, and requires issuers to account separately for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement), in a manner that reflects the issuer
s nonconvertible debt (unsecured debt) borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. The FSP requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The FSP requires retroactive application to the terms of instruments as they existed for all periods presented. The adoption of this FSP primarily affects the accounting for the Company
s 0.25% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2026 and 1.75% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2026. The retroactive application of this FSP resulted in (i) an increase in the opening balance in 2009 of additional paid-in capital and a decrease in retained earnings of $175 million and $97 million, respectively, (ii) an increase in financial expenses and a decrease in income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2008 of $9 million and $1 million, respectively, and (iii) a decrease in basic earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2008 of $.01.

In addition, as described below, in large part as a result of the nature of its business, Teva is frequently subject to patent litigation. Teva believes it has meritorious defenses to the actions to which it is a party and expects to pursue vigorously the defense of each of the ongoing actions, including those described below. Based upon the status of these cases, the advice of counsel, management
s assessment of such cases and potential exposure involved relative to insurance coverage, except as otherwise noted below, no provision has been made in Teva
s financial statements for any of such actions. Teva believes that none of the proceedings described below will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition; however, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgments against Teva, such judgments could be material to its results of operations in a given period. From time to time, Teva seeks to develop generic products for sale prior to patent expiration in various territories. In the United States, to obtain approval for most generic products prior to the expiration of the originator
s patent(s), Teva must challenge the patent(s) under the procedures set forth in the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, as amended by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. To the extent that it seeks to utilize such patent challenge procedures, Teva is and expects to be involved in patent litigation regarding the validity, enforceability or infringement of the originator
s patent(s). Teva may also be involved in patent litigation involving the extent to which alternate manufacturing process techniques may infringe originator or third-party process patents. Additionally, depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors, Teva may, in certain circumstances, elect to market a

), for financial assets and liabilities, and related FSP
s, including FSP FAS 157-3, 
Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active
FSP FAS 157-3
). This pronouncement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. As defined in SFAS No. 157 and clarified by FSP FAS 157-3, fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally effective January 1, 2009, the company adopted the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157-2 relating to non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a significant effect on these financial statements. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Financial items carried at fair value as of March 31, 2009 are classified

Barr
), a U.S.-based multinational generic pharmaceutical company with operations mainly in the United States and Europe, for approximately $4.6 billion in cash and 69 million shares. For accounting purposes, the transaction was valued at approximately $7.5 billion, based on the average value of our shares during the five trading day period commencing two trading days before the date of the merger agreement. In addition, Barr
s net debt as of the acquisition date was approximately $1.5 billion. The consideration for the acquisition was attributed to net assets on the basis of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed this. This allocation has not been finalized. Restructuring provisions recorded were $323 million, mainly related to employee severance, termination of certain agreements and other exit costs, of which approximately $25 million has been paid through March 31, 2009.

Provisions for chargebacks, returns, rebates and other promotional items are included in 
sales reserves and allowances
 under current liabilities. Provision for doubtful debts and prompt payment discounts are netted against 
Accounts receivable.
 The calculation is based on historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements. Chargebacks are the largest component of sales reserves and allowances. Provisions for estimating chargebacks are determined using historical chargeback experience, or expected chargeback levels and wholesaler sales information for new products, which are compared to externally obtained distribution channel reports for reasonableness. Shelf-stock adjustments are granted to customers based on the existing inventory of a customer following actual or anticipated decreases in the invoice or contract price of the related product. Where there is a historical experience to customer returns, Teva records a reserve for estimated sales returns by applying that experience to the amounts invoiced and the amount of returned products to be destroyed versus product that can be placed back in inventory for resale.

EITF 08-7 gives guidance for accounting for defensive intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition in accordance with SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 157, including the estimated useful life that should be assigned to such assets. EITF 08-7 is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company
s consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP 142-3, 
Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company

FAS 141R provides revised guidance on how acquirers recognize and measure the consideration, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contingencies, non-controlling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination, and expands disclosure requirements surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. Key changes include: acquired in-process research and development will no longer be expensed on acquisition, but capitalized and assessed for impairment where relevant and amortized over its useful life; acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred; restructuring costs will generally be expensed in periods after the acquisition date; the consideration

s business develops and following major acquisitions. Historically, Teva presented two reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and API. In 2009, following the acquisition of Barr at the end of 2008, Teva commenced certain organizational changes. Following the completion of these changes, the Company intends to re-evaluate its segment reporting in light of such changes. For purposes of this interim report, Teva has reported two operating segments as in the past. a. Financial data relating to reportable operating segments: Pharmaceutical API* Total U.S. $ in millions Three months ended March 31, 2009: Net sales: To unaffiliated customers $ 2,989 $ 158 $ 3,147 Intersegment

In computing diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, basic earnings per share was adjusted to take into account the potential dilution that could occur upon: (1) the conversion of the convertible senior debentures, using the if-converted method, by adding to net income attributable to Teva interest expense on these debentures, and amortization of issuance costs, net of tax benefits, and by adding to the number of shares the weighted average number of shares issuable upon assumed conversion of these debentures; and (2) the exercise of options and restricted stock units granted under employee stock compensation plans, using the treasury stock method. In computing diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2009, no account was taken of the potential dilution of the convertible senior debentures, amounting to 16 million weighted average shares, since they had an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.

This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008. The company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2009. &nbsp; The company mitigates certain financial exposures, including currency and commodity price risk associated with engineering and construction contracts by utilizing derivative instruments. These instruments are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (SFAS 133). The company formally documents its hedge relationships at the inception of the agreements, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. The company also formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged items. The fair value of all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. For fair value hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is offset against the change in the fair value of the underlying asset through earnings. The effective portion of the contracts&#146; gains or losses due to changes in fair value, associated with the cash flow hedges, are initially recorded as

These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. The maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated costs to complete contracts in progress are not estimable. For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract. For lump-sum or fixed-price contracts, this amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract. Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete. In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co-venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims.&nbsp; As of March&nbsp;31, 2009, no material changes to the amount of financial or performance guarantees outstanding have occurred since the filing of the company&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2008 annual report on Form&nbsp;10-K. &nbsp; Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business on behalf of clients and others in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in

FSP SFAS&nbsp;107-1 and APB 28-1 amends FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;107, &#147;Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,&#148; to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This FSP also amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;28, &#147;Interim Financial Reporting,&#148; to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. This FSP is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009. We do not believe this FSP will have a material impact on the company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. &nbsp; In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;115-2 and SFAS No.&nbsp;124-2, &#147;Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments&#148; (&#147;FSP SFAS&nbsp;115-2 and SFAS&nbsp;124-2&#148;). FSP SFAS&nbsp;115-2 and SFAS&nbsp;124-2 provides guidance to determine whether the holder of an investment in a debt security for which changes in fair value are not regularly recognized in earnings should recognize a loss in earnings when the investment is impaired. This FSP also improves the presentation and disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the consolidated financial statements.

SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008. The company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2009. &nbsp; As a result of the adoption of SFAS 160, the company has separately disclosed on the face of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings for all periods presented the amount of net earnings attributable to the company and the amount of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009, earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was $17.0 million and the related tax effect was $0.5 million. For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008, earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of $8.2 million and the related tax effect of $0.6 million were reclassified from total cost of revenue and income tax expense, respectively, to net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest.&nbsp; Distributions paid to noncontrolling interests were $6.6 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital contributions from noncontrolling interests were $3.9 million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008.

Accordingly, the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) have been adjusted retroactively for all periods presented to reflect the July&nbsp;16, 2008 stock split. &nbsp; In June&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) 03-6-1, &#147;Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities&#148; (&#147;FSP EITF 03-6-1&#148;). FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarified that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. The company&#146;s restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are considered participating securities since the share-based awards contain a nonforfeitable right to dividends irrespective of whether the awards ultimately vest. FSP EITF 03-6-1 requires that the two-class method of computing basic EPS be applied. Under the two-class method, the company&#146;s stock options are not considered to be participating securities. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008 and was adopted by the company during the first quarter of 2009. There was no impact of significance on basic or diluted EPS for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 as a result of the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1. &nbsp; The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 are presented below: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three&nbsp;Months&nbsp;Ended March&nbsp;31, &nbsp; (in&nbsp;thousands,&nbsp;except&nbsp;per&nbsp;share&nbsp;amounts) &nbsp; 2009 &nbsp; 2008 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basic EPS: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net earnings attributable to

Applying the guidance of FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46 (Revised) &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&#148; (&#147;FIN&nbsp;46(R)&#148;), the company evaluates qualitative and quantitative information for each partnership or joint venture at inception to determine, first, whether the entity formed is a variable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;) and, second, if the company is the primary beneficiary and needs to consolidate the entity. Upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in FIN 46(R), the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the entity is a VIE and whether consolidation is still required. &nbsp; A partnership or joint venture is considered a VIE if either (a)&nbsp;the total equity investment is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b)&nbsp;characteristics of a controlling financial interest are missing (either the ability to make decisions through voting or other rights, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity), or (c)&nbsp;the voting rights of the equity holders are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity and/or their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, and substantially all of the entity&#146;s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. &nbsp; The company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidates the entity if the company will absorb a majority of the entity&#146;s expected losses, receive a majority of the entity&#146;s expected residual returns or both.

Other New Accounting Standards FASB Staff Position FAS 141(R)-1 Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination (FSP FAS 141(R)-1 ) The FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R)-1 in April 2009, which became effective for business combinations having an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009. This standard requires an asset or liability arising from a contingency in a business combination to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably determined. If it cannot, the asset or liability must be recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies , and FASB Interpretation No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of the Loss. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157-4) In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-4, which will become effective for the company's interim and annual reporting beginning in the second quarter 2009. The FSP provides additional guidance related to the estimation of fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased, the identification of transactions that are not orderly, and the use of judgment in evaluating the relevance of inputs such as transaction prices. The company does not anticipate the implementation of this new accounting standard will significantly change its valuation or disclosure of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities under the scope of FAS 157. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments (FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2) The FASB issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 during April 2009, and the standard became effective as of April 1, 2009.

These amounts are offset by an equal amount in "Net sales (purchases) of treasury shares." "Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities" included the following cash payments for interest on debt and for income taxes: Three Months Ended March 31 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Interest on debt (net of capitalized interest) $ &#151; $ 3 Income taxes 1,173 3,355 The "Net sales of marketable securities" consisted of the following gross amounts: Three Months Ended March 31 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Marketable securities purchased $ (3 ) $ (599 ) Marketable securities sold 58 858 Net sales of marketable securities $ 55 $ 259 The "Net sales (purchases) of treasury shares" represents the cost of common shares less the cost of shares issued for share-based compensation plans.

Other Contingencies and Commitments Guarantees The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect to guarantees, direct or indirect, of debt of affiliated companies or third parties. Under the terms of the guarantee arrangements, generally the company would be required to perform should the affiliated company or third party fail to fulfill its obligations under the arrangements. In some cases, the guarantee arrangements may have recourse provisions that would enable the company to recover any payments made under the terms of the guarantees from assets provided as collateral. Off-Balance-Sheet Obligations The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contractual obligations relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers' financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline, storage and regasification capacity, drilling rigs, utilities and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company's business. Indemnifications The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the company's interests in those investments. The company would be required to perform if the indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Were that to occur, the company could be required to make future payments up to $300 million. Through the end of March 2009, the company paid $48 million under these indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification payments in the future. The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities related to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred during the period of

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The company implemented FASB Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (FAS 161), as of January 1, 2009. Implementation of FAS 161 did not have any effect on the company's results of operations or consolidated financial position and similarly had no effect on the company's existing use of derivative instruments or hedging activities. However, FAS 161 amended and expanded the disclosures required by FAS 133 in order that they provide an enhanced understanding of how and why the company uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments affect the company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The company's derivative instruments principally include crude-oil, natural-gas and refined-product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts, as well as foreign-currency forward contracts. None of the company's derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments. The company's derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments have no material effect on the company's financial position, financial performance or cash flows. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodities and other derivatives activities, including forward-exchange contracts. Derivative instruments, measured at fair value at March 31, 2009, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows: Consolidated Balance Sheet: Fair Value of Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments Asset Derivatives &#151; Liability Derivatives &#151; Fair Value Fair Value (Millions of dollars) Type of Balance Sheet At March 31 At December 31 Balance Sheet At March 31 At December 31 Derivative Contract Classification 2009 20

Fair Value Measurements FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), and its various amendments, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and stipulates disclosures about fair-value measurements. FAS 157 generally applies to recurring and nonrecurring financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair-value measurements. FAS 157 became effective for Chevron on January 1, 2008, for all financial assets and liabilities and recurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities. On January 1, 2009, FAS 157 became effective for nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Among the required disclosures is the fair-value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value an asset or a liability. The three levels of the fair-value hierarchy are described as follows: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded. Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract. Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair-value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. In the first quarter, the company used Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of a nonrecurring nonfinancial asset. The fair value hierarchy for recurring assets and liabilities measured at fair value at March 31, 2009, is as follows: Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair

Income Taxes Taxes on income for the first quarter of 2009 were $1.3 billion, compared with $4.5 billion for the comparable period in 2008. The associated effective tax rates (calculated as the amount of Income Tax Expense divided by Income Before Income Tax Expense) were 42 percent and 46 percent, respectively. The rate in the first quarter of 2009 was lower due to proportionally higher income being earned in international downstream businesses that were taxed at relatively low rates compared with average rates in international upstream tax jurisdictions.

Employee Benefits The company has defined-benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined-benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where pre-funding provides economic advantages. In the United States, this includes all qualified plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company's other investment alternatives. The company also sponsors other postretirement plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and the retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees in the company's main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. The components of net periodic benefit costs for 2009 and 2008 were: Three Months Ended March 31 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Pension Benefits United States Service cost $ 67 $ 63 Interest cost 120 125 Expected return on plan assets (99 ) (148 ) Amortization of prior-service credits (2 ) (2 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 75 15 Settlement losses 50 19 Total United States 211 72 International Service cost 30 33 Interest cost 69 73 Expected return on plan assets (46 ) (70 ) Amortization of prior-service costs 6 6 Amortization of actuarial losses 26 20 Total International 85 62 Net Periodic Pension Benefit Costs $ 296 $ 134 Other Benefits* Service cost $ 8 $ 7 Interest cost 44 44 Amortization of prior-service credits (20 ) (20 ) Amortization of actuarial losses

Interim Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the company) have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. In the opinion of the company?s management, the interim data include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. The results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, are not necessarily indicative of future financial results. The term ?earnings? is defined as net income attributable to Chevron Corporation. Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company?s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the first quarter 2009, the company recorded after-tax gains of $400 million on the sale of international downstream assets.

New Accounting Standard &#151; Noncontrolling Interests The company adopted FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160), effective January 1, 2009, and retroactive to the earliest period presented. Prospectively, certain changes in a parent's ownership interest are to be accounted for as equity transactions and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value. With the adoption of FAS 160, ownership interests in the company's subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent's equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Shown in the table below is activity for the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests during the first quarters of 2009 and 2008: Amount 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Balance at January 1 $ 469 $ 204 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 17 28 Distribution to noncontrolling interests (7 ) (17 ) Other changes, net 24 2 Balance at March 31 $ 503 $ 217

The company?s capitalized cost of suspended wells at March 31, 2009, was $2.2 billion, an increase of $100 million from year-end 2008 due to drilling activities in the United States. For the category of exploratory well costs at year-end 2008 that were suspended more than one year, a total of $48 million was expensed in the first three months of 2009.

Litigation MTBE Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to 36 pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company?s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States. Ecuador Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations, and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet?s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation program

Summarized Financial Data &#151; Chevron U.S.A. Inc. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. CUSA and its subsidiaries manage and operate most of Chevron's U.S. businesses. Assets include those related to the exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and those associated with refining, marketing, supply and distribution of products derived from petroleum, excluding most of the regulated pipeline operations of Chevron. CUSA also holds the company's investment in the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC joint venture, which is accounted for using the equity method. During 2008, Chevron implemented legal reorganizations in which certain Chevron subsidiaries transferred assets to or under CUSA. The summarized financial information for CUSA and its consolidated subsidiaries presented in the table below gives retroactive effect to the reorganizations as if they had occurred on January 1, 2008. However, the financial information below may not reflect the financial position and operating results in the future or the historical results in the period presented if the reorganization actually had occurred on that date.

Operating Segments and Geographic Data Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. For this purpose, the investments are grouped as follows: upstream &#151; exploration and production; downstream &#151; refining, marketing and transportation; chemicals; and all other. The first three of these groupings represent the company's "reportable segments" and "operating segments" as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (FAS 131). The segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes "segment managers" who report to the company's "chief operating decision maker" (CODM) (terms as defined in FAS 131). The CODM is the company's Executive Committee, a committee of senior officers that includes the Chief Executive Officer, and that in turn reports to the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation. The operating segments represent components of the company as described in FAS 131 terms that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. Segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular contact with the company's CODM to discuss the segment's operating activities and financial performance. The CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major changes to the annual capital and exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers within the operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and all oth

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden Tower and the East and West Towers. In August 2004, we extended the lease agreement for our East and West Towers for an additional five years with an option to extend for an additional five years solely at our election. In June 2009, we submitted notice to the lessor that we intend to exercise our option to renew this agreement for an additional five years effective August, 2009. In March 2007, the Almaden Tower lease was extended for five years, with a renewal option for an additional five years solely at our election. As part of the lease extensions, we purchased the lease receivable from the lessor of the East and West Towers for $126.8 million and a portion of the lease receivable from the lessor of the Almaden Tower for $80.4 million, both of which are recorded as investments in lease receivables on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. This purchase may be credited against the residual value guarantee if we purchase the properties or will be repaid from the sale proceeds if the properties are sold to third-parties. Under the agreement for the East and West Towers and the agreement for the Almaden Tower, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time during the lease term for approximately $143.2 million and $103.6 million, respectively. The residual value guarantees under the East and West Towers and the Almaden Tower obligations are $126.8 million and $89.4 million, respectively. These two leases are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of May 29, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may demand we purchase the buildings for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the buildings. Both leases qualify for operating lease ac

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program, consisting of reductions in workforce of approximately 560 full-time positions globally and the consolidation of facilities, in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 totaling $29.2 million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of the 560 full-time positions globally. Charges associated with these ongoing termination benefits were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 112, 
Employers
 Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.
 As of November 28, 2008, $0.4 million was paid. In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we continued to implement restructuring activities under this program. We vacated approximately 89,000 square feet of research and development and sales facilities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, 
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,
 we accrued $8.5 million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under the operating lease using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, estimated at approximately 6% as of the date we ceased to use the leased property. This amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately $3.9 million. We also recorded charges of $3.4 million for termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 43 of the remaining 100 full-time positions expected to be terminated. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we accrued an additional $3.0 million under this program for termination benefits related to the elimination of approximately 48 of the remaining 57 full-time positions expected to be terminated.

Amendment
), which increased the total senior unsecured revolving facility from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion. The Amendment also permits us to request one-year extensions effective on each anniversary of the closing date of the original agreement, subject to the majority consent of the lenders. We also retain an option to request an additional $500.0 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate facility of $1.5 billion. In February 2008, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement dated February 26, 2008, which extended the maturity date of the facility by one year to February 16, 2013. The facility would terminate at this date if no additional extensions have been requested and granted. All other terms and conditions remain the same. The facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio. At the Company
s option, borrowings under the facility accrue interest based on either the London interbank offered rate (
LIBOR
) for one, two, three or six months, or longer periods with bank consent, plus a margin according to a pricing grid tied to this financial covenant, or a base rate. The margin is set at rates between 0.20% and 0.475%. Commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.05% and 0.15% per year based on the same pricing grid. The facility is available to provide loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries for general corporate purposes. As of both May 29, 2009 and November 28, 2008, the amount outstanding under the credit facility was $350.0 million, which is included in long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of May 29, 2009, we were in compliance with all of the covenants.

Our interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. These financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 on file with the SEC. There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.

 EQUITY Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third-parties. We did not enter into any new structured repurchase agreements during the six months ended May 29, 2009. During the six months ended May 30, 2008, we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $250.0 million. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (
VWAP
) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During the six months ended May 29, 2009, we repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares at an average price of $22.70 through structured repurchase agreements, which included prepayments from fiscal 2008. During the six months ended May 30, 2008, we repurchased 16.6 million shares at an average price of $36.58 through structured repurchase agreements, which included prepayments from fiscal 2007. No prepayments were remaining as of May 29, 2009. As of Nove

Legal Proceedings
 in Part I, Item 3 of the Form 10-K filed by NYSE Euronext for the year ended December 31, 2008, which disclosures are incorporated herein by reference, and no other matters were reportable during the period. In re NYSE Specialists Securities Litigation In an order dated March 14, 2009, the district court granted the plaintiffs
 motion for class certification with respect to the claims alleging violations of federal securities laws by the specialist firm defendants; those defendants filed a petition for interlocutory appeal of that order. The order does not apply to a separate claim asserted against New York Stock Exchange, Inc. alleging that it made false and misleading statements concerning the regulation and operation of its market; the dismissal of that claim was remanded to the district court in 2007, but further proceedings have not been scheduled. In addition to the matter described above and in the 10-K, NYSE Euronext is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. NYSE Euronext does not believe, based on currently available information, that the results of any of these various proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its operating results or financial condition.

Fair Value Measurements
SFAS No. 157
). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments is determined using various techniques that involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency and the complexity of the instruments. In accordance with SFAS No. 157, NYSE Euronext has categorized its financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: " Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that NYSE Euronext has the ability to access. Generally, equity and other securities listed in active markets and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices are reported in this category. " Level 2: Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Generally, municipal bonds, certificates of deposits, corporate bonds, mortgage securities, asset backed securities and certain derivatives are reported in this category. The valuation of these instruments is based on quoted prices or broker quotes for similar instruments in active markets. " Level 3: Some inputs are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement and reflect management
s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Generally, assets and

 FINRA As part of the July 30, 2007 asset purchase agreement with FINRA, FINRA and NYSE Group have entered into service agreements with FINRA and its affiliates. Based on these service agreements and pre-existing arrangements with NYSE Amex, FINRA provides certain regulatory services to NYSE Group and its affiliates. LCH.Clearnet For the year ended December 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext used the services of LCH.Clearnet Ltd. (
LCH.Clearnet
) for clearing transactions executed on its European cash markets and NYSE Liffe, and the services of Euroclear for settling transactions on its cash markets (except in Portugal). As of March 31, 2009, NYSE Euronext retained a 5% stake in LCH.Clearnet
s outstanding share capital and the right to appoint one director to LCH.Clearnet
s board of directors. On October 31, 2008, NYSE Euronext announced that its London derivatives subsidiary had entered into binding agreements with LCH.Clearnet to terminate its current clearing arrangements. Under the agreements, we established new arrangements known as 
NYSE Liffe Clearing
, whereby the London Market of NYSE Liffe would take full responsibility for clearing activities in its London market. To achieve this, the London Market of NYSE Liffe will become a self-clearing Recognised Investment Exchange and will outsource certain clearing functions to LCH.Clearnet. As part of the termination of its current clearing arrangements with LCH.Clearnet, NYSE Euronext will make a one-time

As part of the business combination between NYSE Group and Euronext, NYSE Euronext entered into a plan to eliminate employee positions. In addition, in 2008, NYSE Euronext initiated a new plan in Europe, which included an estimated net reduction of 200 employees. Based on current estimates, NYSE Euronext expects the net reduction to exceed 200 employees.

NYSE Euronext evaluates segment performance primarily based on operating income from continuing operations. U.S. Operations consist of (i) obtaining new listings and servicing existing listings; (ii) providing access to trade execution in cash equities, options and futures; (iii) selling market and related information and distributing market information to data subscribers; (iv) issuing trading licenses; (v) providing data processing operations; (vi) providing regulatory services in the U.S. markets and (vii) providing trading technology, software and connectivity to end-users. European Operations consist of (i) the management of trading in all cash products as well as a wide range of derivatives products and bonds and repos; (ii) listing of cash instruments; (iii) the sale of market data and related information; (iv) settlement of transactions and the safe-custody of physical securities in certain European markets and (v) providing electronic trading solutions as well as software and connectivity to end-users.

ACQUISITIONS 2009 Acquisition On January 2, 2009, the Company acquired the assets of PROSA, a web printing company located in Santiago, Chile. The purchase price for PROSA was approximately $23.6 million. PROSA
s operations are included in the International segment. The operations of PROSA are complementary to the Company
s existing facility in Chile, and the acquisition is expected to improve the Company
s ability to serve customers in Latin America, increase capacity utilization, and reduce management, procurement and manufacturing costs. The PROSA acquisition was recorded by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net amounts assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The final purchase price allocation is as follows: Accounts receivable $ 2.5 Property, plant and equipment 9.1 Amortizable intangible assets 8.6 Goodwill 6.5 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (2.5 ) Deferred taxes
net (0.6 ) Net cash paid $ 23.6 The fair values of machinery and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of PROSA were determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, 
Fair Value Measurements

). Plant and equipment values were estimated based on discussions with machinery and equipment brokers, dealer quotes, and internal expertise related to the equipment and current marketplace conditions. Intangible asset values, including customer relationships and a non-compete agreement, were estimated based on future cash flows and customer attrition rates discounted using an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. 2008 Acquisitions On March 14, 2008, the Company acquired Pro Line Printing, Inc.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change and are not discounted. The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party in twelve federal and state Superfund sites. In addition to the Superfund sites, the Company may also have the obligation to remediate six other previously owned facilities and four other currently owned facilities. At the Superfund sites, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act provides that the Company
s liability could be joint and several, meaning that the Company could be required to pay an amount in excess of its proportionate share of the remediation costs. The Company
s understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the Superfund sites and of other liable parties at the previously owned facilities has been considered, where appropriate, in the determination of the Company
s estimated liability. The Company established reserves, recorded in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, that it believes are adequate to cover its share of the potential costs of remediation at each of the Superfund sites and the previously and currently owned facilities. While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. From time to time, the Company

), all derivatives are recorded as other assets or other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes, or in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, depending on the purpose for which the derivative is held. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not meet the criteria for designation as a hedge at inception, or fail to meet the criteria thereafter, are recognized currently in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. At the inception of a hedge transaction, the Company formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge. In addition, the Company assesses both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative in the hedging transaction has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and whether the derivative is expected to continue to be highly effective. The impact of any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates. The exposure to foreign currency movements is limited in most countries, because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (
FASB
) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, 
Fair Value Measurements
SFAS 157
), which was adopted in the first quarter of 2008 for financial assets and the first quarter of 2009 for non-financial assets. This statement clarified the definition of fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value, and expanded the disclosures on fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Company
s consolidated financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), 
Business Combinations
SFAS 141(R)
), which the Company adopted January 1, 2009. SFAS 141(R) retained the fundamental requirements in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, 
Business Combinations
SFAS 141
), which required that the acquisition method of accounting (formerly known as the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and changed the accounting treatment for certain acquisition related costs, restructuring activities, and acquired contingencies, among other changes. SFAS 141(R) retained the guidance in SFAS 141 for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. This statement was required to be adopted for acquisitions consummated after December 31, 2008, with certain provisions applied to earlier acquisitions. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) by the Company during the first quarter of 2009 did not have a material impact on the Company
s consolidated financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The Company expects that its adoption will reduce the Company
s operating earnings due to required recognition of acquisition and restructuring costs through operating earnings. The magnitude of this impact will be dependent on the number, size and nature of acquisitions in periods subsequent to adoption. In December 2007, the

On December 24, 2008, we purchased the remaining 4.8% interest in Liberty Japan MC that we did not already own for 
615.8 million ($6.8 million at the transaction date). On December 25, 2008, J:COM purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of Mediatti for total cash consideration before direct acquisition costs of 
28,350.6 million ($310.5 million at the transaction date), of which Liberty Japan MC received 
12,887.0 million ($141.1 million at the transaction date). The Mediatti valuation process remains open and we expect that the most significant adjustments to the preliminary allocation will involve intangible assets, deferred revenue and deferred income taxes. J:COM acquired Mediatti in order to achieve certain financial, operational and strategic benefits through the integration of Mediatti with J:COM
s existing operations. Acquisition of Interkabel Pursuant to an agreement with four associations of municipalities in Belgium, which we refer to as the pure intercommunales or the 
PICs,
 that was executed on June 28, 2008 (the 2008 PICs Agreement), Telenet acquired from the PICs, effective October 1, 2008, certain cable television assets (Interkabel), including (i) substantially all of the rights that Telenet did not already hold to use the broadband communications network owned by the PICs (the Telenet PICs Network) and (ii) the analog and digital television activities of the PICs, including the entire subscriber base (together with the acquisition of the rights to use the Telenet PICs Network, the Interkabel Acquisition). The Interkabel valuation process remains open and we expect that the most significant adjustments to the preliminary allocation will involve long-lived assets and deferred i

We expect that in the ordinary course of business, operating leases that expire generally will be renewed or replaced by similar leases. Contingent Obligations In connection with the April 13, 2005 combination of VTR and Metr
polis Intercom SA (Metr
polis), Cristaler
as de Chile SA (Cristaler
as) acquired the right to require UGC to purchase Cristaler
 equity interest in VTR at fair value, subject to a $140 million floor price. This put right is exercisable by Cristaler
as until April 13, 2015. Upon the exercise of this put right by Cristaler
as, UGC has the option to use cash or shares of LGI common stock to acquire Cristaler
 interest in VTR. The fair value of this put right at March 31, 2009 was a liability of $15.3 million. The minority owner of Chello Central Europe Zrt (Chello Central Europe), a subsidiary of Chellomedia in Hungary, has the right to put all (but not part) of its interest in Chello Central Europe to one of our subsidiaries each year between January 1 and January 31. This put option lapses if not exercised by February 1, 2011. Chellomedia has a corresponding call right. The price payable upon exercise of the put or call right will be the fair value of the minority owner
s interest in Chello Central Europe. In the event the fair value of Chello Central Europe on exercise of the put right exceeds a multiple of ten times EBITDA, as defined in the underlying agreement, Chellomedia may in its sole discretion elect not to acquire the minority interest and the put right lapses for that year, with the minority shareholder being instead entitled to sell its minority interest to a third party within three months of such date, subject to Chellomedia

These installments represent the first two of six equal semi-annual installments beginning on March 31, 2009. In accordance with the compensation committee
s determination, we (i) paid cash aggregating $56.4 million ($3.4 million of which was paid subsequent to March 31, 2009) and granted on February 18, 2009 9,464 restricted share units with respect to LGI Series A common stock and 9,094 restricted share units with respect to LGI Series C common stock to settle the first installment of the awards earned under the LGI Performance Plans and (ii) granted restricted share units on February 18, 2009 with respect to 2,016,351 shares of LGI Series A common stock and 1,937,265 shares of LGI Series C common stock to settle the second installment of the awards earned under the LGI Performance Plans.

(the UGC Convertible Notes) (see note 8). UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) is an indirect subsidiary of LGI and the indirect parent of UPC Holding, Telenet, VTR and Austar. The reported fair values of these assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2009 likely will not represent the value that will be realized upon the ultimate settlement or disposition of these assets and liabilities. In the case of the investments that we account for using the fair value method, the values we realize upon disposition will be dependent upon, among other factors, market conditions and the historical and forecasted financial performance of the investees at the time of any such disposition. With respect to our equity-related derivatives, we expect settlement to occur through the surrender of the underlying shares. With respect to our cross-currency interest rate swaps and our interest rate swaps, we expect that the values realized will be based on market conditions at the time of settlement, which may occur at the maturity of the derivative instrument or at the time of the repayment or refinancing of the underlying debt instrument. SFAS 157 provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. A summary of the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value is as follows: March 31, 2009 Fair value measurements at March 31, 2009 usi

SFAS 141(R) replaces SFAS 141, Business Combinations , and, among other items, generally requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize (i) the assets acquired, (ii) the liabilities assumed (including those arising from contractual contingencies), (iii) any contingent consideration and (iv) any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, at fair values as of that date. The requirements of SFAS 141(R) will result in the recognition by the acquirer of goodwill attributable to the noncontrolling interest in addition to that attributable to the acquirer. SFAS 141(R) also provides that the acquirer shall not adjust the finalized accounting for business combinations, including business combinations completed prior to the effective date of SFAS 141(R), for changes in acquired tax uncertainties or changes in the valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets that occur subsequent to the effective date of SFAS 141(R). SFAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We prospectively adopted the provisions of SFAS 141(R) effective January 1, 2009. SFAS 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2007.

However, the market values of the publicly-traded equity of our company and certain of our publicly-traded subsidiaries remain at historically low levels and we continue to experience difficult economic environments and significant competition in most of our markets.

115.4 million ($152.7 million) aggregate principal amount of its existing 7.75% Senior Notes due 2014, together with a cash payment of 
4.6 million ($6.1 million) and (ii) 
69.1 million ($91.4 million) aggregate principal amount of its 8.625% Senior Notes due 2014 together with a cash payment of 
4.1 million ($5.4 million) for 
184.4 million ($243.9 million) aggregate principal amount of new 9.75% Senior Notes due April 2018. In connection with this exchange transaction, UPC Holding paid the accrued interest on the exchanged Senior Notes and incurred applicable commissions and fees. On April 30, 2009, UPC Holding also issued 
65.6 million ($86.8 million) principal amount of the new 9.75% Senior Notes due April 2018 at an original issue discount of 16.5%, resulting in cash proceeds before commissions and fees of 
54.8 million ($72.5 million). The net proceeds from the issuance of the new 9.75% Senior Notes, after deducting applicable commissions and fees, will be used for general corporate purposes. UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Transactions Upsizing of Facilities Q and R. On April 27, 2009, UPC Broadband Holding entered into two new facility accession agreements to increase the sizes of Facility Q and Facility R under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility by 
70.0 million ($92.6 million) and 
27.3 million ($36.1 million), respectively. In connection with these new accession agreements, certain lenders under the

We identify our reportable segments as those consolidated subsidiaries that represent 10% or more of our revenue, operating cash flow (as defined below), or total assets. In certain cases, we may elect to include an operating segment in our segment disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable segment. We evaluate performance and make decisions about allocating resources to our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and operating cash flow. In addition, we review non-financial measures such as subscriber growth, as appropriate. Operating cash flow is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance and to decide how to allocate resources to segments. As we use the term, operating cash flow is defined as revenue less operating and SG&amp;A expenses (excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, provisions for litigation, and impairment, restructuring and other operating charges or credits). We believe operating cash flow is meaningful because it provides investors a means to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using criteria that is used by our internal decision makers. Our internal decision makers believe operating cash flow is a meaningful measure and is superior to other available GAAP measures because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allows management to (i) readily view operating trends, (ii) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (iii) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. For example, our internal decision makers believe that the inclusion of impairment and restructuring charges within operating cash flow would d

In February 2009, our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we were authorized to acquire from time to time up to $250 million of our LGI Series A and Series C common stock through open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, which may include derivative transactions. The timing of the repurchase of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase programs, which may be suspended or discontinued at any time, will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions. During the first three months of 2009, we acquired 7,508,400 shares of our LGI Series C common stock at a weighted average price of $14.62 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $109.8 million, including direct acquisition costs. At March 31, 2009, the remaining amount authorized under our current repurchase program was $235.2 million. Noncontrolling Interests During the three months ended March 31, 2009, our condensed consolidated financial statements were not materially impacted by changes in the percentage interests that we own in our majority-owned subsidiaries. For information concerning the redemption features of certain of our noncontrolling interests, see note 13.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to LGI stockholders presents the dilutive effect, if any, on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., options, nonvested common shares and convertible securities) as if they had been exercised, vested or converted at the beginning of the periods presented. We reported net losses attributable to LGI stockholders during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008. Therefore, the dilutive effect at March 31, 2009 and 2008 of (i) the aggregate number of then outstanding options, SARs and nonvested shares of approximately 29.5 million and 26.3 million, respectively, (ii) the aggregate number of shares issuable pursuant to the then outstanding convertible debt securities and other obligations that may be settled in cash or shares of approximately 38.7 million and 45.9 million, respectively, and (iii) the number of shares contingently issuable pursuant to LGI performance-based incentive plans of 14.4 million and 11.4 million, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share attributable to LGI stockholders because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the computation.

Commitments and Contingencies Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of business, Autodesk provides indemnifications of varying scopes, including limited product warranties and indemnification of customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products or services. Autodesk accrues for known indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Historically, costs related to these indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, Autodesk is unable to estimate the maximum potential effect of these indemnifications on its future results of operations. In connection with the purchase, sale or license transactions of assets or businesses with third parties, Autodesk has entered into or assumed customary indemnification agreements related to the assets or businesses purchased, sold or licensed. Historically, costs related to these indemnifications or guarantees have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, Autodesk is unable to estimate the maximum potential effect of these indemnifications on its future results of operations. As permitted under Delaware law, Autodesk has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at Autodesk
s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments Autodesk could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, Autodesk has Directors
 and Officers
 Liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce its financial exposure and may enable Autodesk to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Autodesk believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.

s policy that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held with, and in the custody of, financial institutions with high credit standing. Autodesk
s primary commercial banking relationship is with Citibank and its global affiliates (
Citibank
). Autodesk
s cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified institutions globally. Citicorp USA, Inc., an affiliate of Citibank, is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of the Company
s $250.0 million U.S. line of credit. Citibank, like many financial institutions, has obtained government assistance. It is Autodesk
s policy to limit the amounts invested with any one institution by type of security and issuer. See further discussion in Note 4, 
Financial Instruments
 below. Total sales to the distributors Tech Data Corporation and its global affiliates (
Tech Data
) accounted for 14% and 17% of Autodesk
s consolidated net revenue for the first quarters of fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of the net revenue from sales to Tech Data relates to Autodesk
s Platform Solutions and Emerging Business segment and comes from outside the U.S. In addition, Tech Data accounted for 19% and 12% of gross accounts receivable at April 30, 2009 and January 31, 2009, respectively.

Financial Instruments Derivative Financial Instruments On February 1, 2009, Autodesk adopted FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, 
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement 133,
SFAS 161
). The adoption of SFAS 161 had no financial impact on Autodesk
s consolidated financial statements and only required additional financial statement disclosures. Autodesk has applied the requirements of SFAS 161 on a prospective basis. Accordingly, disclosures related to interim periods prior to the date of adoption have not been presented. Under its risk management strategy, Autodesk uses derivative instruments to manage its short-term exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which exist as part of ongoing international business operations. Autodesk
s general practice is to use forward and option collar contracts to hedge a majority of transaction exposures denominated in euros, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, British pounds and Canadian dollars. These foreign currency instruments have maturities between one to 12 months in the future. Autodesk does not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Cash Flow Hedges Autodesk utilizes purchased foreign currency option collar contracts and forwards to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. These option collar and forward contracts, which are designated and documented as cash flow hedges, qualify for special hedge accounting treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
SFAS 133
). The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts is assessed quarterly using regression as well as other timing and probability criteria required by SFAS 133. For cash flow hedges designated for the quarter ending April 30, 2009 time value was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Stock-Based Compensation Stock Plans As of April 30, 2009, Autodesk maintained two active stock plans for the purpose of granting stock awards to employees and to non-employee members of Autodesk
s Board of Directors: the 2008 Employee Stock Plan (
2008 Plan
), which is available only to employees, and the 2000 Directors
 Option Plan, as amended (
2000 Plan
), which is available only to non-employee directors. Additionally, there are six expired or terminated plans with options outstanding, including the 2006 Employee Stock Plan (
2006 Plan
), which was replaced by the 2008 Plan in March 2008. The 2008 Plan was approved by Autodesk
s stockholders in November 2007. Under this plan, 16.5 million shares of Autodesk common stock, in addition to 0.5 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 Plan upon its expiration, were reserved for issuance. The 2008 Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units; however, no more than 2.5 million of the shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 Plan may be issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units. At April 30, 2009, 7.2 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan will expire in March 2011. The 2000 Plan, which was originally approved by the stockholders in June 2000, allows for an automatic annual grant of options to non-employee members of Autodesk
s Board of Directors. At April 30, 2009, 0.8 million shares were available for future issuance. The 2000 Plan will expire in March 2010. Autodesk
s Board of Directors adopted the 2010 Outside Directors
 Stock Plan on March 12, 2009, and it is subject to the approval of the Company
s shareholders at the Annual Shareholders meeting on June 11, 2009. Options granted under the 2008 Plan and the 2000 Plan vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within four to seven years from the date of grant. The exercise price of all stock options granted under these plans was equal to the

s effective tax rate was negative 65% and 25% during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Autodesk
s effective tax rate during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 differs from the effective tax rate during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $20.9 million discrete non-cash tax charge from recording a valuation allowance against certain California deferred tax assets partially offset by a discrete tax benefit of $7.7 million associated with the impairment of goodwill that were recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, the effective tax rate of negative 65% for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 is lower than the Federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to foreign income taxes at lower rates and Federal and state research tax credits, partially offset by the impact of SFAS 123R. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the State of California enacted significant California tax law changes. As a result of the enacted legislation, the Company expects that in fiscal years 2012 and beyond the Company
s income subject to tax in California will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly its California deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized. The Company recorded a net discrete tax charge of $20.9 million related to the re-measurement of the Company
s California deferred tax assets to account for this change in tax law, as well as an increase in the valuation allowance for the Company
s California deferred tax assets that existed as of January 31, 2009. The Company will continue to assess its valuation allowance on its California deferred tax assets in future periods. At April 30, 2009, Autodesk had net deferred tax assets of $134.9 million. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets.

Restructuring Reserve In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Autodesk initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce operating costs. This program has reduced the number of employees by approximately 700 positions globally and will result in the consolidation of up to 27 leased facilities. In connection with this restructuring, Autodesk recorded charges totaling $16.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the consolidation of fifteen leased facilities globally, and one-time termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 80 positions. These restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, 
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 As of April 30, 2009, of the $55.6 million in total accrued restructuring charges, $35.3 million has been paid. The remaining accrual associated with the termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Autodesk expects to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal 2018. A summary of the restructuring and other costs by segment recognized during the three months ended April 30, 2009 are as follows: Employee Severance and Benefits Facilities Total Amounts incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2010: Platform Solutions and Emerging Business $ 0.3 $

M&amp;E
) segment as of April 30, 2009. This goodwill balance related to the M&amp;E segment
s fourth quarter fiscal 2009 acquisition of Softimage. In May 2009, the Company concluded that an impairment of goodwill had occurred as of April 30, 2009 due to revisions to the Company
s revenue and cash flow projections prepared in the second half of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 in response to the significant and sustained revenue declines it was experiencing in all segments and geographies in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The revenue and cash flow projections were substantially impacted for all segments; the M&amp;E segment was the only segment which had a current fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its assets.

Borrowing Arrangements As of April 30, 2009, Autodesk had $2.1 million of outstanding borrowings, which were recorded in 
Borrowings under line of credit
 on the balance sheet. Autodesk has two lines of credit, a U.S. line of credit and a China line of credit. Autodesk
s U.S. line of credit facility permits unsecured short-term borrowings of up to $250.0 million, and is available for working capital or other business needs. The credit agreement contains customary covenants, which could restrict liens, certain types of additional debt and dispositions of assets if Autodesk fails to maintain its financial covenants. The line of credit is syndicated with various financial institutions, including Citicorp USA, Inc., a Citibank affiliate, which is the primary lender and agent. Autodesk had no outstanding borrowings on this line at April 30, 2009. This facility expires in August 2012. Autodesk
s China line of credit facility permits unsecured short-term borrowings of up to $5.0 million, and is available for working capital needs. At April 30, 2009, Autodesk had $2.1 million of outstanding borrowings on this line of credit, which contains customary covenants. Autodesk drew on this line of credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 for working capital purposes. This facility has no contractual expiration. The weighted average interest rate on Autodesk
s line of credit facilities was 5.10% and 1.01% at April 30, 2009 and January 31, 2009, respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards In April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (
FASB
) issued Staff Position FSP No. 141R-1 Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies (
FSP 141R-1
). FSP 141R-1 amends the provisions in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007) 
Business Combinations
SFAS 141R
) for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. FSP 141R-1 eliminates the distinction between contractual and non-contractual contingencies, including the initial recognition and measurement criteria in SFAS 141R and instead carries forward most of the provisions in SFAS 141 for acquired contingencies. FSP 141R-1 is effective for Autodesk for contingent assets and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after February 1, 2009. Autodesk expects that FSP 141R-1 will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, term and size of the acquired contingencies. In April 2009, the FASB issued three related Staff Positions: (i) FSP 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (
FSP 157-4
), (ii) FSP Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 115-2 and SFAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments, (
FSP SFAS 115-2
 and 
SFAS 124-2
), and (iii) FSP SFAS 107-1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, (
FSP SFAS 107
 and 
APB 28-1
), each of which will be effective for Autodesk for interim and annual periods beginning with its second quarter of fiscal 2010. FSP 157-4 provides guidance on how to determine the fair value

Subsequent Events Autodesk approved and began implementing a new restructuring plan in May 2009. The restructuring plan is expected to result in a staff reduction of approximately 430 positions and consolidation of up to 32 leased facilities around the world in order to reduce Autodesk
s operating expenses. Autodesk anticipates incurring restructuring and impairment charges of $33 million to $40 million, of which, $20 million to $25 million would be for one-time employee termination benefits and $13 million to $15 million would be for facilities-related costs. Substantially all of these charges will be expensed in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and third quarter of fiscal 2010. These charges would result in cash payments of approximately $31 million to $38 million, consisting of one-time employee termination and lease termination payments.

PSEB
), Architecture, Engineering and Construction (
), Manufacturing (
MFG,
 renamed from Manufacturing Solutions in February 2009) and Media and Entertainment (
M&amp;E
). Location Services, which Autodesk disposed of in February 2009, is not included in any of the above reportable segments, and is reflected as Other. In the first quarter of fiscal 2010 Autodesk reorganized its business to better align with its customers and accelerate product innovation. As part of this change there has been some product movement between business segments, including the movement of Geospatial and Process and Power design market products from PSEB to AEC. Certain reclassifications to segment revenue and gross profit have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. Autodesk believes that reporting in these four segments is consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, 
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (as amended).
 Autodesk has no material inter-segment revenue. The PSEB, AEC and MFG segments derive revenue from the sale of licenses for software products and services to customers who design, build, manage or own building, manufacturing and infrastructure projects. The M&amp;E segment derives revenue from the sale of products to creative professionals, post-production facilities, and broadcasters for a variety of applications, including feature films, television programs, commercials, music and corporate videos, interactive game production, web design and interactive web streaming. PSEB, consisting of Autodesk
s core platform, AutoCAD, underpins the Company
s design offerings for all industries. AutoCAD provides a platform for Autodesk
s developer partners to build custom solutions for a range of diverse design-oriented markets and for AEC and MFG to offer tailored versions of AutoCAD for their markets. PSEB
s revenue primarily includes revenue fr

Stock Repurchase Program Autodesk has a stock repurchase program that helps offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under the Company
s employee stock plans and returns excess cash generated from its business to stockholders. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010 Autodesk did not repurchase or retire any shares of its common stock. As of April 30, 2009, 16.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under this program. The number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors, including anticipated employee stock purchases during the period, the level of the Company
s cash balances, general business and market conditions, the market price of Autodesk stock, cash on hand and available in the U.S., Company defined trading windows and other investment opportunities.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Autodesk, Inc. (
Autodesk
 or the 
Company
) as of April 30, 2009, and for the three months ended April 30, 2009, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for interim financial information along with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission (
) Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles (
GAAP
) for annual financial statements. In management
s opinion, Autodesk has made all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring and non-recurring adjustments) during the quarter that were considered necessary for fair presentation of the financial position and operating results of the Company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, the results of operations for the three months ended April 30, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year ending January 31, 2010, or for any other period. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, together with management

The following table sets forth the computation of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share amounts: Three months Ended April 30, 2009 2008 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ (32.1 ) $ 94.6 Denominator: Denominator for basic net income (loss) per share

 6.4 Denominator for dilutive net income (loss) per share 227.1 232.6 Basic net income (loss) per share $ (0.14 ) $ 0.42 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ (0.14 ) $ 0.41 In accordance with the FASB
s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, 
Earnings per Share,
 the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share does not include shares that are anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method because their exercise prices are higher than the average market value of Autodesk
s stock during the period. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and 2009, 31.2 million and 13.8 million potentially dilutive shares, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.

Acquisitions On February 24, 2009, the Company acquired the money transfer business of European-based FEXCO, one of the Company
s largest agents providing services in a number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Ireland. The acquisition of FEXCO
s money transfer business will position the Company to benefit from the upcoming implementation of the Payment Services Directive (
) in the European Union. The PSD will make it possible to operate in 27 countries under a single license and allow the Company to expand its distribution beyond banks and post-banks in most of those countries. The acquisition does not impact the Company
s revenue, because the Company was already recording 100% of the revenue arising from money transfers originating at FEXCO
s subagents. As of the acquisition date, the Company no longer incurs commission costs for transactions related to FEXCO; rather, the Company now only pays commissions directly to former FEXCO subagents, resulting in lower overall commission expense. The Company
s operating expenses include costs attributable to FEXCO
s operations subsequent to the acquisition date. All acquisition costs have been expensed in 
Selling, general and administrative
 in the Company
s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 24.65% interest in FEXCO Group Holdings (
FEXCO Group
), which was a holding company for both the money transfer business as well as various unrelated businesses. The Company surrendered its 24.65% interest in FEXCO Group as non-cash consideration, which had an estimated fair value of $86.2 million on the acquisition date, and paid 
123.1 million ($157.4 million) as additional consideration for 100% of the common shares of the money transfer business, resulting in a total purchase price of $243.6 million. The Company recognized no gain or loss in connection with the disposition of its equity interest in the FEXCO Group, because its estimated fair value approximated its carrying value.

Commitments and Contingencies In the normal course of business, Western Union is subject to claims and litigation. Management of Western Union believes such matters involving a reasonably possible chance of loss will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on Western Union
s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Western Union accrues for loss contingencies as they become probable and estimable. The Company has $87.1 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at March 31, 2009 with expiration dates through 2015, certain of which contain a one-year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements. The Company expects to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement with First Data in connection with Western Union
s spin-off from First Data on September 29, 2006 (
Spin-off
), First Data and the Company are each liable for, and agreed to perform, all liabilities with respect to their respective businesses. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement also provides for cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of the Company
s business with the Company and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of First Data
s retained businesses with First Data. The Company also entered into a tax allocation agreement that sets forth the rights and obligations of First Data and the Company with respect to taxes imposed on their respective businesses both prior to and after the Spin-off as well as potential tax obligations for which the Company may be liable in conjunction with the Spin-off (See Note 14).

Derivatives The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the euro, and to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and other currencies, related to forecasted revenues and also on settlement assets and obligations denominated in these and other currencies. Additionally, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to changes in market rates both prior to and subsequent to the issuance of debt. The Company uses derivatives to minimize its exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and not to engage in speculative derivative activities. Foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps of varying maturities are used in these risk management activities. The Company executes derivative financial instruments, which it designates as hedges, with established financial institutions having credit ratings of 
 or better from major rating agencies. The credit risk inherent in these agreements represents the possibility that a loss may occur from the nonperformance of a counterparty to the agreements. The Company performs a review of the credit risk of these counterparties at the inception of the hedge, on a quarterly basis and as circumstances warrant. The Company also monitors the concentration of its contracts with any individual counterparty. The Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements, but takes action (including termination of contracts) when doubt arises about the counterparties
 ability to perform. The Company
s foreign currency exposures are in liquid currencies, consequently there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the hedging program would not be available in the future. The details of each designated hedging relationship are formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks bein

Stock Compensation Plans 2006 LTIP In February 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Company
s board of directors granted the Company
s executives long-term incentive awards under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (
2006 LTIP
) which consisted of one-third restricted stock units, one-third stock option awards and one-third performance-based cash awards. The performance-based cash awards are based on strategic performance objectives for the next two years and are payable in equal installments on the second and third anniversaries of the award, assuming the applicable performance objectives are satisfied. Based on their contributions to the Company and additional assumed responsibilities, certain executives received an incremental grant of restricted stock units which fully vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, non-executive employees of the Company participating in the 2006 LTIP received annual equity grants of 50% stock option awards and 50% restricted stock units, representing a change from the 75% stock option awards and 25% restricted stock awards or units previously granted under the 2006 LTIP. The employee stock option awards vest in 25% increments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date and restricted stock units vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date.

s effective tax rates on pre-tax income for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 were 26.6% and 29.2%, respectively. The Company continues to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign-derived and therefore taxed at lower rates than its combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. In addition, the decreasing effective tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 is also attributed to the implementation in 2008 of foreign tax efficient strategies consistent with the Company
s overall tax planning. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company has established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to its international operations, which were restructured in 2003. The Company
s tax reserves reflect management
s judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While the Company believes its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to these reserves, the Company
s income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any difference from the Company
s tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the amounts otherwise recognized in the Company
s financial statements, and are reflected in 
Income taxes payable
 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, was $386.1 million and $361.2 million, respectively, excluding interest and penalties. A substantial portion of

Company
) is a leader in global money transfer, providing people with fast, reliable and convenient ways to send money around the world. The Western Union 
 brand is globally recognized. The Company
s services are available through a network of agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories. Each location in the Company
s agent network is capable of providing one or more of the Company
s services. The Western Union business consists of the following segments: " Consumer-to-consumer
money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third-party agents using the Company
s multi-currency, real-time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for international cross-border transfers
that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another
and, in certain countries, intra-country transfers
that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. " Consumer-to-business
the processing of payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations that receive consumer payments, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers and government agencies, sometimes referred to as 
billers,
 through Western Union
s network of third-party agents and various electronic channels. While the Company continues to pursue international expansion of its offerings in selected markets, such as its offerings of walk-in, cash bill payment service in certain countries in Central and South America, the segment
s revenue was primarily generated in the United States during all periods presented. All businesses that have not been classified into the consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business segments are reported as

Restructuring and Related Expenses Missouri and Texas Closures During 2008, the Company closed substantially all of its facilities in Missouri and Texas and did not renew the Company
s collective bargaining agreement with the unionized workers employed at these locations. The decision also resulted in the elimination of certain management positions in these same facilities and resulted, along with other actions, in the Company no longer having employees working in the United States under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company incurred severance and employee related benefit expenses for all union and certain affected management employees, facility closure expenses and other expenses associated with the relocation of these operations to existing Company facilities and third-party providers, including costs related to hiring, training, relocation, travel and professional fees. The Company incurred cumulative total expenses of $46.3 million comprised of $13.1 million, $7.3 million, $7.8 million and $18.1 million in severance and other employee related costs, asset write-offs and incremental depreciation, lease terminations and other restructurings expenses, respectively, through December 31, 2008. No additional restructuring and related expenses were incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2009. Other Reorganizations Also during 2008, in addition to the Missouri and Texas closures, the Company restructured some of its operations and relocated or eliminated certain shared service and call center positions. The relocated positions were moved to the Company
s existing facilities or outsourced service providers in 2008. The Company incurred cumulative total expenses of $36.6 million comprised of $31.2 million, $0.6 million and $4.8 million in severance and other employee related costs, asset write-offs and incremental depreciation and other restructuring expenses, respectively, through December 31, 2008.

Segments As previously described in Note 1, the Company classifies its businesses into two reportable segments: consumer-to-consumer and consumer-to-business. Operating segments are defined by SFAS No. 131, 
 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ,
 as components of an enterprise which constitute businesses, about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Company
s chief operating decision maker (
CODM
) in deciding where to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The consumer-to-consumer reporting segment is viewed as one global network where a money transfer can be sent from one location to another, anywhere in the world. The segment, which consists of three regions, is now managed as two areas, primarily to coordinate agent network management and marketing activities. The CODM makes decisions regarding resource allocation and monitors performance based on specific corridors within and across these regions, but also reviews total revenue and operating profit of each region. These regions frequently interact on transactions with consumers and share processes, systems and licenses, thereby constituting one global consumer-to-consumer money transfer network. The regions and corridors offer generally the same services distributed by the same agent network, have the same types of customers, are subject to similar regulatory requirements, are processed on the same system, and have similar economic characteristics, allowing the geographic regions to be aggregated into one reporting segment. Historically, consumer-to-consumer segment revenue has increased sequentially from the first quarter to the fourth quarter in most years and declined from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of the following year. This seasonal fluctuation is related to the holiday season in various countries during the fourth quarter. All businesses that have not been classified into consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business are reported as 
Other.

Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested, using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes proceeds from the exercise price of stock options, the unamortized compensation expense and assumed tax benefits of options and restricted stock are available to acquire shares at an average price throughout the year, and therefore, reduce the dilutive effect throughout the year. As of March 31, 2009 and 2008, there were 43.1 million and 8.2 million, respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti-dilutive. The increase in anti-dilutive shares is primarily due to the majority of the Company
s outstanding options having an exercise price higher than the Company
s average stock price for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The following table provides the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding 707.1 746.7 Common stock equivalents 0.9 10.1 Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 708.0 756.8

Employee Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Plans The Company has two frozen defined benefit pension plans for which it has a recorded unfunded pension obligation of $106.8 million and $107.1 million as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, included in 
Other liabilities
 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. No contributions were made to these plans by the Company in 2008 or during the three months ended March 31, 2009. Due to the impact of legislation enacted in late 2008, the Company will not be required to contribute to these plans during 2009, but estimates it will be required to fund approximately $20 to $25 million in 2010.

Settlement Assets and Settlement Obligations Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received from agents for unsettled money transfers and consumer payments. Western Union records corresponding settlement obligations relating to amounts payable under money transfer and payment service arrangements. Settlement assets and obligations are comprised of the following (in millions): March 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 Settlement assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 20.0 $ 42.3 Receivables from selling agents 692.5 759.6 Investment securities 469.7 405.6 $ 1,182.2 $ 1,207.5 Settlement obligations: Money transfer and payment service payables $ 787.4 $ 799.5 Payables to agents 394.8 408.0 $ 1,182.2 $ 1,207.5 Investment securities consist primarily of high-quality state and municipal debt instruments. Substantially all of the Company
s investment securities were marketable securities during the periods presented. The Company is required to maintain specific high-quality, investment grade securities and such investments are restricted to satisfy outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable state regulations. Western Union does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. All investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. Western Union regularly monitors credit risk and attempts to mitigate its exposure by making high-quality investments. At March 31, 2009, the significant majority of the Company
s investment securities had credit ratings of 
 or better from a major credit rating agency. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and presented as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of related deferred taxes. As of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, gross unrealized gains were $2.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, offset by gross unrealized losses of $0.4 millio

Receivable for Securities Sold On September 15, 2008, Western Union requested redemption of its shares in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd., a money market fund, (the 
Fund
) totaling $298.1 million, which was included in 
Other assets
 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. At the time the redemption request was made, the Company was informed by the Reserve Management Company, the Fund
s investment advisor (the 
Manager
), that the Company
s redemption trades would be honored at a $1.00 per share net asset value. In January 2009, the Company received a partial distribution of $193.6 million from the Fund. As of March 31, 2009, the Company had a remaining balance of $104.5 million which is included in 
Other assets
 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company expects to receive and is vigorously pursuing collection of the remaining balance based on the maturities of the underlying investments in the Fund, the written and verbal representations from the Manager to date and the Company
s legal position regarding its right to full payment. Nevertheless, due to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of litigation facing the Fund, as well as potential variability in the ultimate amount and timing of the recovery of the remaining balance, the fair value of this financial asset may be less than the related carrying value. There is a risk that the redemption process could be delayed and that the Company could receive less than the $1.00 per share net asset value should pro-rata distribution occur. Based on net asset information provided by the Fund, the Company
s exposure related to pro-rata distribution could be approximately $12 million, excluding potential costs incurred by the Fund.

Accordingly, estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable (greater than a 75% probability) that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the loss contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred. Operating Segments The Company?s operating segments are identified in Note 25. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company?s commitments and contingencies specifically described in this Note 27 relate to the Corporate and Other reportable segment. The Nevada Operations matters under Newmont USA Limited relate to the North America reportable segment. The PT Newmont Minahasa Raya matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. The Yanacocha matters relate to the South America reportable segment. The Newmont Yandal Operations Pty Limited matter relates to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. The PTNNT matters relate to the Asia Pacific reportable segment. Environmental Matters The Company?s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects.

The notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 3.0% per annum. As a result of adopting FSP APB 14-1, the effective interest rate increased to 8.5%. The notes are convertible, at the holder's option, equivalent to a conversion price of $46.25 per share of common stock. The portion of the proceeds ($74) related to the conversion feature has been recognized as additional paid-in capital. The Company retrospectively applied FSP APB 14-1 to the 2014 and 2017 convertible senior notes. During the first quarter of 2009, PTNNT shareholders loaned an additional $124 to PTNNT. Total principal outstanding under the shareholder loans was $165 and $41 as of March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, 43.75% or approximately $72 and $18, respectively, were due to Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation, an affiliate of Sumitomo Mining Corporation, an unrelated third party, and was non-recourse to Newmont, with the remainder payable to Newmont.

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are described below: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; Level 3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). The following table sets forth the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by FAS 157, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company?s business conducted within the country involved. At March 31, 2009, the Company?s total unrecognized tax benefit was $173 for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns. Of this, $124 represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company?s effective income tax rate. Also included in the balance at March 31, 2009 are $11 of tax positions that, due to the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of which would not affect the annual effective tax rate. As a result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions with respect to which none of the issues are individually significant, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease by approximately $3 to $5 in the next 12 months.

Options to purchase 4.6 million and 1.2 million shares of common stock at average exercise prices of $47.16 and $54.73 were outstanding at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted weighted average number of common shares because the strike prices of the options exceeded the price of the common stock. In July 2007 and February 2009, Newmont issued $1,150 and $518, respectively, of convertible notes that, if converted in the future, would have a potentially dilutive effect on the Company's stock. Under the indenture for the convertible notes, upon conversion Newmont is required to settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion obligation (stock price in excess of the conversion price) in cash, shares or a combination thereof.

Newmont has a 56.25% interest in NTP and the Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTP in turn owns 80% of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara ("PTNNT"), the Indonesian subsidiary that operates the Batu Hijau mine. Newmont identified NTP as a Variable Interest Entity as a result of certain capital structures and contractual relationships and has fully consolidated Batu Hijau in its consolidated financial statements since January 1, 2004. The remaining 20% interest in PTNNT is owned by P.T. Pukuafu Indah ("PTPI"), an unrelated Indonesian company. NTP's interest in PTNNT is the subject of an international arbitration proceeding and a final award concerning PTNNT's interest was issued by the arbitration panel on March 31, 2009. For further information concerning the arbitral award, see Note 27.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have been included. The results reported in these interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year. These interim statements should be read in conjunction with Newmont?s Consolidated Financial Statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, filed February 19, 2009. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (?GAAP?). Certain amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and at December 31, 2008 have been revised. The adjustments are of a normal recurring nature except as discussed below. The Company retrospectively adopted FSP No. APB 14-1, ?Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)? (?FSP APB 14-1?), which requires an allocation of convertible debt proceeds between the liability component and the embedded conversion option (i.e., the equity component) (see Note 2). Additionally, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 160, ?Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements ? an amendment of ARB No. 51? (?FAS 160?), which requires the noncontrolling interests to be classified as a separate component of net income and stockholders? equity. References to ?A$? refer to Australian currency, ?C$? to Canadian currency, ?IDR? to Indonesian currency, ?NZ$? to New Zealand currency and ?$? to United States currency.

Upon expected completion of the acquisition in the second quarter, subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and approvals, Newmont will own 100% of the project. Consideration for the acquisition consists of $750 payable in cash at closing, $240 payable in cash and/or Newmont common stock, at the Company?s option, in December 2009, and a contingent payment capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized operating margin (if any) exceeding $600 per ounce, payable on one-third of gold sales from Boddington. Newmont will also reimburse all capital expenditures funded by AngloGold from January 1, 2009 through the closing date. During the first quarter of 2009, we expensed $8 in acquisition costs, and expect to incur an additional $55-$60 in the second quarter of 2009, primarily related to transfer taxes. In the first quarter of 2009, La Herradura (of which Newmont owns 44%) purchased a mining property near its Mexico operation for cash consideration of $11 (Newmont?s 44% share). In December 2007, the Company purchased approximately 70% of the common shares of Miramar Mining Corporation (?Miramar?), which, in addition to the shares previously owned, brought the Company?s interest in Miramar to approximately 78%. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of Miramar. All shares were purchased for C$6.25 per share in cash.

The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange risk, diesel price risk, and interest rate risk. In accordance with FAS 133, the Company designated currency fixed forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges, diesel forward contracts as cash flow hedges, and interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of a fixed-rate borrowing. All of the derivative instruments were transacted for risk management purposes and qualify as hedging instruments under FAS 133. The maximum period over which hedged forecasted transactions are expected to occur is three years. Cash Flow Hedges Foreign Currency Contracts Newmont entered into a series of foreign currency contracts to reduce the variability of the US dollar amount of forecasted foreign currency expenditures caused by changes in currency rates. Newmont entered into IDR/$ forward purchase contracts to hedge up to 80% of the Company's IDR denominated operating expenditures which results in a blended IDR/$ rate realized each period. The hedges are forward purchase contracts with expiration dates ranging up to one year from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period IDR/$ rates. For the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008, the IDR/$ forward purchase contracts increased Batu Hijau Costs applicable to sales by $2 and reduced Batu Hijau Costs applicable to sales by $1, respectively. As of March 31, 2009, the Company has hedged 23% of its expected remaining 2009 IDR operating expenditures. Newmont implemented a multi-year systematic, disciplined layered program to hedge up to 85% of the Company's A$ denominated operating expenditures with forward contracts that have expiration dates ranging up to three years from the date of issue. The principal hedging objective is reduction in the volatility of realized period-on-period $/A$

The objective of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is to require more detailed disclosures about employers' plan assets, including employers' investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The Company adopted the provisions of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 on January 1, 2009. The provisions of this FSP are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. Equity Method Investment In November 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached consensus on Issue No. 08-6, "Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations" ("EITF 08-6"), which clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. The intent of EITF 08-6 is to provide guidance on (i) determining the initial measurement of an equity method investment, (ii) recognizing other-than-temporary impairments of an equity method investment and (iii) accounting for an equity method investee's issuance of shares. EITF 08-6 was effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009 and has been applied prospectively. The adoption of EITF 08-6 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. Equity-Linked Financial Instruments In June 2008, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 07-5, "Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock" (

Income Taxes As of March 2009 and December 2008, the Company had approximately $48 millionand $57 million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits. Afterconsideration of the impact of federal tax benefits, $41 million and $50million, respectively, could favorably affect the effective income tax rate. TheCompany estimates that approximately $12 million of the net unrecognized taxbenefits as of March 2009 for various state and federal income tax matters willbe resolved over the next 12 months. Approximately $4 million of this totalwill be recognizable upon the expiration of various statutes of limitation. Thefinal outcome of the remaining uncertain tax positions, however, is not yetdeterminable. As a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation and the resolution ofother income tax matters during the first quarter 2009, the Company recordedincome tax and interest benefits of $13 million. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes itsprincipal domestic subsidiaries. CSX and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S.federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. During 2008, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed examinations of taxyears 2004 through 2006 as well as for 2007. The Company has appealed a taxadjustment proposed by the IRS with respect to the 2004 through 2006 period anda related amount is included in the uncertain tax positions above. This appealsprocess is expected to last more than one year. Federal examinations oforiginal federal income tax returns for all years through 2007 are otherwiseresolved. CSX's continuing practice is to recognize net interest and penalties related toincome tax matters in income tax expense. As of March 2009 and December 2008,the Company had a $5 million gross receivable and a $2 million gross payablebefore the consideration of state tax impacts, respectively, accrued forinterest and penalties. The payable changed to a receivable due to theexpiration of statutes of limitation noted above.

This series of notes is included in the consolidated balance sheets under long-term debt. The notes may be redeemed in whole or in part by CSX at any time. CSX expects to use approximately $300 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay debt maturing in the next twelve months. The balance of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, improvements in productivity and repurchases of CSX common stock. Revolving Credit Facility CSX has a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks. The facility allows borrowings at floating rates based on the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR"), plus a spread depending upon ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Group to CSX's senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money. The facility requires CSX to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization below a prescribed limit. The facility contains no provisions that would require CSX to post collateral. As of March 2009, this facility was not drawn on, and CSX was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the facility. This facility expires in 2012.

However, should a number of these items occur in the same period,they could have a material effect on the financial condition, results ofoperations or liquidity in that particular period. Casualty Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupationalinjury claims. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed theCompany's self-insured retention amount. To the extent the value of anindividual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company wouldpresent the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable forinsurance recoveries. Personal injury and occupational claims are presented ona gross basis and in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies("SFAS 5"). These reserves fluctuate based upon changes in independent thirdparty estimates, which are reviewed by management, and are offset by the timingof payments. Most of the claims were related to CSXT unless otherwise noted. Defense and p

Earnings Per Share The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per shareand earnings per share, assuming dilution: First Quarters 2009 2008 Numerator (millions): Net Earnings $246 $351 Interest Expense on Convertible Debt - Net of Tax - 1 Net Earnings, If Converted $246 $352 Denominator (thousands): Average Common Shares Outstanding 391,160 404,351 Convertible Debt 1,118 5,717 Stock Options Common Stock Equivalents (a) 1,823 4,361 Other Potentially Dilutive Common Shares - 781 Average Common Shares Outstanding, Assuming Dilution 394,101415,210 Basic Earnings Per Share: Net Earnings $0.63 $0.87 Earnings Per Share, Assuming Dilution: Net Earnings $0.62 $0.85 (a) In calculating diluted earnings per share, SFAS 128, Earnings Per Sharerequires CSX to include the potential shares that would be outstanding if alloutstanding stock options were exercised. This is offset by shares CSX couldrepurchase using the proceeds from these hypothetical exercises to obtain thecommon stock equivalent. This number is different from outstanding stockoptions, which is included in Note 3, Share-Based Compensation. All stockoptions were dilutive for the periods presented; therefore no stock options wereexcluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of sharesof common stock outstanding. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, is based onthe weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted forthe effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the followingtypes of potentially dilutive instruments: - convertible debt, - employee stock options, and - other equity awards, which include long-term incentive awards. EITF 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted EarningsPer Share, requires CSX to include additional shares in the computation ofearnings per share, assuming dilution. The amount included in diluted earningsper share represents the number of shares that would be issued if all of CSX

Share-Based Compensation CSX share-based compensation plans primarily include performance grants,restricted stock awards, stock options and stock plans for directors. CSX hasnot granted stock options since 2003. Awards granted under the various plansare determined and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board ofDirectors or, in certain circumstances, by the Chief Executive Officer forawards to management employees other than senior executives. The Board ofDirectors approves awards granted to the Company's non-management Directors uponrecommendation of the Governance Committee. Total pre-tax expense associated with share-based compensation and its relatedincome tax benefit is as follows: First Quarters (Dollars in millions) 2009 (a) 2008Share-Based Compensation Expense $(8) $14Income Tax Expense / (Benefit) 3 (5) (a) In 2009, the Company reduced share-based compensation expense to reflecta change in estimate of the number of performance-based awards that areexpected to vest. The following table provides information about stock options exercised. First Quarters (In thousands) 2009 2008 Number of Stock Options Exercised 74 1,858 As of December 2008, all outstanding options are vested and therefore there willbe no future expense related to these options. As of March 2009, CSX hadapproximately 7 million stock options outstanding. However, the impact todiluted earnings per share is much smaller see Note 2, Earnings Per Share for more information.

Commitments and Contingencies Insurance The Company maintains numerous insurance programs, most notably forthird-party casualty liability and for Company property damage and businessinterruption, with substantial limits. A certain amount of risk is retained bythe Company on each of the casualty and property programs. For the first eventin any given year, the Company has a $25 million deductible for each of thecasualty and non-catastrophic property programs and a $50 million deductible forthe catastrophic property program. Guarantees CSX and certain of its subsidiaries are contingently liable, individuallyand jointly with others, as guarantors of approximately $57 million inobligations principally relating to leased equipment, vessels and jointfacilities used by the Company in its current and former business operations.Utilizing the Company's guarantee for these obligations allows the obligor totake advantage of lower interest rates and obtain other favorable terms.Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company that could requireCSX or one of its affiliates to make payment to, or to perform certain actionsfor, the beneficiary of the guarantee based on another entity's failure toperform. As of first quarter 2009, the Company's guarantees primarily related to thefollowing: - Guarantee of approximately $49 million of obligations of a formersubsidiary, CSX Energy, in connection with a sale-leaseback transaction. CSXis, in turn, indemnified by several subsequent owners of the subsidiary againstpayments made with respect to this guarantee. Management does not expect thatCSX will be required to make any payments under this guarantee for which CSXwill not be reimbursed. CSX's obligation under this guarantee will be completedin 2012. - Guarantee of approximately $8 million of lease commitments assumed by A.P.Moller-Maersk ("Maersk") for which CSX is contingently liable. CSX believesMaersk will fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to such leasecommitments, and CSX will have no further liabil
